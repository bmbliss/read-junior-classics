THE SLEEPY SONGAS
Shewent to the seamstress
To buy him some linen,
Butwhen she came back
The dog was spinning.
She went to the hosier's
To buy him some hose,
But when she came back
Hewas dress'd in his clothes.
Thedame made a curtsey,
Thedogmade abow;
The dame said, "Your servant,"
The dog said, "Bow, wow."


THE SLEEPY SONG
By Josephine Daskam Bacon
S soon as the fire burns red and low
Andthe house upstairs is still,
She sings me a queer little sleepy song,
Of sheep that go over the hill.
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
Their colors are gray and white;
They follow their leader nose and tail,
For they must be home by night.
Andone slips over, and one comes next,
Andone runs after behind;
The gray one's nose at the white one's tail,
The top of the hill they find.
