RULE BRITANNIA
But if you want to drive 'way sorrow,
Come and hear dis song to-morrow,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dar's buckwheat cakes an' Injen batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter ;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Denhoe it down and scratch your grabble,
To Dixie's Land I'm bound to trabble,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
