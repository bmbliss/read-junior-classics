AMORTIFYING MISTAKE
Heavy are your eyes, my sweet,
Weary are your little feet- Nestle closer up to me
In your pretty cap and gown;
Don't detain
The Shut-Eye train!
"Ting-a-ling! " the bell it goeth,
"Toot-toot ! " the whistle bloweth;
Oh, the sights that we shall see !
All aboard for Shut-Eye Town!

IAMORTIFYING MISTAKE
By Anna Maria Pratt
STUDIED my tables over and over, and backward and forward too ;
But I couldn't remember six times nine, and I
didn't know what to do,
Till sister told me to play with mydoll, and not to
bother my head.
"If you call her 'Fifty-four' for a while, you'll learn it by heart," she said.
So I took my favorite, Mary Ann (though I
thought ' twas a dreadful shame To give such a perfectly lovely child such a per- fectly horrid name) ,
And I called her my dear little "Fifty-four" a
hundred times, till I knew
The answer of six times nine as well as the answer
of two times two.
