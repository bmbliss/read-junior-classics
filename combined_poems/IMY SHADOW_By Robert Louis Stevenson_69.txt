MY SHADOW
Out of Eternity
This new Day is born;
Into Eternity,
At night, will return.
Behold it aforetime
No eye ever did :
So soon it forever
From all eyes is hid.
Here hath been dawning
Another blue Day;
Think wilt thou let it
Slip useless away.


IMY SHADOW
By Robert Louis Stevenson
HAVE a little shadow that goes in and out with
me,
And what can be the use of him is more than I
can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
The funniest thing about him is the way he likes togrow- Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
