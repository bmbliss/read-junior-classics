THE COLORED BAND
It is done!
In the circuit of the sun
Shall the sound thereof go forth.
It shall bid the sad rejoice,
It shall give the dumb a voice,
It shall belt with joy the earth!
Ring and swing,
Bells of joy! On morning's wing Send the song of praise abroad!
With a sound of broken chains,
Tell the nations that He reigns,
Who alone is Lord and God!


WTHE COLORED BAND
By Paul Laurence Dunbar
'EN de colo'd ban' comes ma'chin' down de
street
You kin hyeah de ladies all erroun' repeat :
"Ain't dey handsome? Ain't dey gran' ?
Ain't dey splendid? Goodness, lan' !
W'y dey's pu'fect f'om dey fo'heads to dey feet!"
An' sich steppin' to de music down de line.
'Tain't de music by itself dat meks it fine ;
Hit's de walkin' , step by step,
An' de keepin' time wid "Hep,"
Dat it mek a common ditty soun' divine.
