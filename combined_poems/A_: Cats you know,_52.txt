: Cats you know,
Wash just so,
Then their whiskers grow.
Flies have hairs too short to comb,
So they fly bareheaded home;
But the gnat Wears a hat
Do you believe that?
Flies can see
More than we,
So how bright their eyes must be!
Little fly,
Ope your eye;
Spiders are near by.
For a secret I can tell,
Spiders never use flies well.
Then away
Do not stay,
Little fly, good day.
A BABY'S FEET
By Algernon Charles Swinburne
BABY'S feet, like sea shells pink,
Might tempt, should heaven see meet,
An angel's lips to kiss, we thinkAbaby's feet.
Like rose-hued sea flowers toward the heat
They stretch and spread and wink Their ten soft buds that part and meet.
