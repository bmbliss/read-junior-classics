THE SEA
Long, long afterward, in an oak
I found the arrow, still unbroke;
Andthe song, frombeginning to end,
Ifoundagain in the heart of afriend.


TTHE SEA
By Barry Cornwall
HE sea, the sea, the open sea,
The blue, the fresh, the ever free;
Without a mark, without abound,
It runneth the earth's wide regions round:
It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,
Or like a cradled creature lies .
I'm on the sea, I'm on the sea,
I am where I would ever be,
With the blue above and the blue below,
Andsilence wheresoe'er I go.
If a storm should come and awake the deep,
What matter? I shall ride and sleep.
I love, O, how I love to ride
On the fierce, foaming, bursting tide,
Where every madwave drowns the moon,
And whistles aloft its tempest tune
And tells how goeth the world below,
Andwhy the southwest wind doth blow!
I never was on the dull, tame shore
But I loved the great sea more and more,
