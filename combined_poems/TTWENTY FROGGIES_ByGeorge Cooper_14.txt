TWENTY FROGGIES
Andwhen they get to the top of the hill
They quietly slip away,
But one runs over, and one comes next,
Their colors are white and gray.
And over they go, and over they go,
And over the top of the hill
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
And the house upstairs is still.
And one slips over, and one comes next,
The good little, gray little sheep !
Iwatchhow the fire burns red and low,
Andshe says that I fall asleep.


TTWENTY FROGGIES
ByGeorge Cooper
WENTY froggies went to school,
Down beside a rushy pool,
Twenty little coats of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
"We must be in time," said they, ...
"First we study, then we play;
That is how we keep the rule,
When we froggies go to school."
Master Bull-frog, brave and stern,
Called his classes in their turn,
Taught them how to nobly strive,
Alsohow to leap and dive;

A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
Taught them how to dodge a blow,
From the sticks that bad boys throw.
Twenty froggies grew up fast,
Bull-frogs they became at last ;
Polished in a high degree,
As each froggie ought to be,
Now they sit on other logs,
Teaching other little frogs.
A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
By Richard Le Gallienne
So far and fast to-day;
ran
The birds are weary, for who sang
So many songs as they?
The bees and butterflies at last
Are tired out, for just think, too,
Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through,
And so, as all tired people do,
They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds.
The sun has shut his golden eye
And gone to sleep beneath the sky,
The birds and butterflies and bees
Have all crept into flowers and trees,
And all lie quiet, still as mice,
Till morning comes-like father's voice.
So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you

SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!
Must sleep away till morning, too.
Close little eyes, down little heads,
And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.
