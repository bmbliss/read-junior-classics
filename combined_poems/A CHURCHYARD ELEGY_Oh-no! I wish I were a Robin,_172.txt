A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
Oh-no! I wish I were a Robin,
ARobin or a little Wren, everywhere to go;
Through forest, field, or garden,
And ask no leave or pardon,
Till winter comes with icy thumbs To ruffle up our wing!
Well-tell! Where should I fly to,
Where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell?
Before a day was over,
Home comes the rover,
For mother's kiss-sweeter this
Than any other thing.
