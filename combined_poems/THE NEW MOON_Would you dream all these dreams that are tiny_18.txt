THE NEW MOON
Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny
and fleet?
They'll come to you sleeping;
So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street,
With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
Comes stealing; comes creeping.


DTHE NEW MOON
Anonymous
EAR mother, how pretty The moon looks to-night!
She was never so cunning before;
Her two little horns
Are so sharp and so bright,
Ihope she'll not grow any more.
If I were up there,
With you and my friends,
I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;
I'd sit in the middle
Andhold by both ends ;
Oh, what abright cradle 'twould be!
Iwould call to the stars
To keep out of the way,
Lest we should rock over their toes ;
And then I would rock
Till the dawn of the day,
And see where the pretty moon goes.
