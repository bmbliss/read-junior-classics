PROCRASTINATION
For a' that, and a' that,
His riband, star, and a' that,
Theman of independent mind,
He looks and laughs at a' that.
Aprince can make a belted knight,
Amarquis, duke, and a' that ;
But an honest man's aboon his might,
Guid faith he maunna fa' that !
For a' that, and a' that,
Their dignities, and a' that,
The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth,
Are higher rank than a' that.
Then let us pray that come it mayAs come it will for a' thatThat sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,
Maybear the gree, and a' that ;
For a' that, and a' that,
It's coming yet for a' that,
That man to man, the warld o'er,
Shall brothers be for a' that!


SPROCRASTINATION
By Robert Southwell
HUN delays, they breed remorse;
Take thy time while time is lent thee;
Creeping snails have weakest force;
Fly thy fault, lest thou repent thee;
Good is best when soonest wrought,
Lingering labors come to naught.

CARDINAL WOLSEY'S SPEECH
Hoist up sail while gale doth last ;
Tide and wind wait no man's pleasure;
Seek not time when time is past;
Sober speed is wisdom's leisure ;
Afterwits are dearly bought,
Let thy forewit guide thy thought.
