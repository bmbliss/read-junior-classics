MORNINGB
And as the much-loved shore we near,
With transport we behold the roof
Where dwelt a friend or partner dear,
Of faith and love a matchless proof.
The lead once more the seaman flung,
And to the watchful pilot sung,
"Quarter less-five !"
Now to her berth the ship draws nigh :
We shorten sail-she feels the tide-
" Stand clear the cable" is the cryThe anchor's gone; we safely ride.. The watch is set, and through the night
Wehear the seamen with delight
Proclaim-"All's well! "


MORNING
By James Beattie
UT who the melodies of morn can tell?
The wild brook babbling down the mountain
side;
The lowing herd; the sheepfold's simple bell ;
The pipe of early shepherd dim descried
In the lone valley; echoing far and wide The clamorous horn along the cliffs above;
The hollow murmur of the ocean tide;
The hum of bees, the linnet's lay of love,
And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.
The cottage curs at early pilgrim bark;
Crowned with her pail the tripping milkmaid sings ;
The whistling ploughman stalks afield; and, hark !
