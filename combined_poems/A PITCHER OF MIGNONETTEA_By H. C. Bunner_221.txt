A PITCHER OF MIGNONETTE
You Moon! have you done something wrong in
heaven,
That God has hidden your face?
I hope if you have, you will soonbe forgiven,
And shine again in your place.
O velvet Bee! you're a dusty fellow,
You've powdered your legs with gold;
O brave marsh Mary-buds, rich and yellow!
Give me your money to hold.
O Columbine! open your folded wrapper Where two twin turtle-doves dwell;
O Cuckoo-pint! toll me the purple clapper,
That hangs in your clear, green bell.
Andshow me your nest with the young ones in it I will not steal them away,
Iam old! you may trust me, Linnet, Linnet- I am seven times one to-day.


A PITCHER OF MIGNONETTEA
By H. C. Bunner
PITCHER of mignonette,
In a tenement's highest casement:
Queer sort of flower-pot-yet
That pitcher of mignonette Is a garden in heaven set,
To the little sick child inthe basement
The pitcher of mignonette,
In the tenement's highest casement.
