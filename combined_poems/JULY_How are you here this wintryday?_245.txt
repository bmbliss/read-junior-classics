JULY
How are you here this wintryday?
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Your radiant fellows yet delay.
No wind flower dances scarlet gay,
Nor crocus flame lights up the way.
What land of cloth o' gold andgreen,
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Cloth o' gold with the green between.
Was that you left but yestere'en,
To light a gloomy world and mean?
King Trumpeter to Flora's queen,
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Blow, and the goldenjousts begin.
