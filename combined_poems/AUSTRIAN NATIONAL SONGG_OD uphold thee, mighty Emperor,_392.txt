AUSTRIAN NATIONAL SONGG
OD uphold thee, mighty Emperor,
Monarch of our Eastern land.
Power and Wisdom e'er attend thee,
Righteousness with thee shall stand,
Till the laurel crown'd, a victor,
All hearts bow at thy command.
God uphold thee, and defend thee,
Emperor of our Austrian land!
Happy flow'ry land!
His scepter rules o'er valley, mount and plain.
Mildly, calmly, justly ruleth,
He the people's love would gain,
Yet his weaponed might, in splendor Beams thro' all the land amain.
God uphold thee, warrior, Father,
Monarch of our Austrian land!
He delights the poor to cherish,
He awakes the minstrel's lay,
He would not that any perish,
All admire the gentle sway.
"Heaven reward him, God defend him,"
Thus we sing, and thus we pray.
Kaiser, Emperor, Monarch, Father,
All thy peaceful rule obey!
He from bondage will deliver,
He would make us truly free !
