MTHE LAMPLIGHTER
Ytea is
sky;
By Robert Louis Stevenson
nearly ready and the sun has left the
It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
For every night at teatime, and before you take
your seat,
With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up
the street.
Now Tom would be adriver and Maria go to sea,
And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;
But I, when I am stronger and can choose what
I'm to do,
O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the
lamps with you!
For we are very lucky, with alamp before the door,
And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many
more;
