WISHING
And I found an angle-worm A-poking up his headHe maybe feeds on seeds and such,
And so I squashed him dead.
A seed's so very small ;
And dirt all looks the sameHow can they know at all The way they ought to aim?
And so I'm waiting 'round
In case of any need;
Afarmer ought to do his best for
Every single seed!


WISHING
By William Allingham
ING- TING! RING I wish I were a Primrose,
A bright yellow Primrose, blowing in the spring!
The stooping boughs above me,
The wandering bee to love me,
The fern and moss to creep across,
And the Elm-tree for our king!
Nay-stay! I wish I were an Elm-tree,
Agreat, lofty Elm-tree, with green leaves gay!
The winds would set them dancing,
The sun and moonshine glance in,
The birds would house among the boughs,
And sweetly sing.
