THE LIGHT BRIGADE
Those silent patient lips too well foretold.
Yes, this is he who ruled a world of men
As might some prophet of the elder dayBrooding above the tempest and the fray With deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken.
Apower was his beyond the touch of art Or armÃ«d strength-his pure and mighty heart.


THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHTBRIGADE
By Alfred Tennyson
league, HALFHalfaaleague league, halfonward alead,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
"Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Was there a man dismay'd?
Not tho' the soldier knew
Some one had blunder'd :
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die :
Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.

THE LIGHT BRIGADE
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley'd and thunder'd;
Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.
Flash'd all their sabers bare,
Flash'd as they turn'd in air Sab'ring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd:
Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel'd from the saber-stroke
Shatter'd and sunder'd.
Then they rode back, but not,
Not the six hundred.
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volley'd and thunder'd:
Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well Came through the jaws of Death Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of themLeft of six hundred.

PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
When can their glory fade?
Oh, the wild charge they made!
All the world wondered.
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade- Noble six hundred!
