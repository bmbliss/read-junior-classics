ALMOND BLOSSOM
Hewent to the windows of those who slept,
And over each pane, like a fairy, crept ;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he slept,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things-there were flowers and
trees;
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees ;
There were cities with temples and towers, and these
All pictured in silver sheen!
But he did one thing that was hardly fair;
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
That all had forgotten for him to prepare-
"Nowjust to set them a-thinking,
I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,
"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,
And the glass of water they've left for me Shall ' tchich! to tell them I'm drinking."


ALMOND BLOSSOM
By Edwin Arnold
BLOSSOM of the LOSSOM of the almond-trees,
April's gift to April's bees,
Birthday ornament of spring,
Flora's fairest daughterling;-
Coming when no flowerets dare
Trust the cruel outer air,
When the royal king-cup bold
Dares not donhis coat of gold,
