THE DUELT
Tiny woods below whose boughs Shady fairies weave a house ;
Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
Where the braver fairies climb !
Fair are grown-up people's trees,
But the fairest woods are these ;
Where, if I were not so tall,
I should live for good and all.


THE DUEL
By Eugene Field
HE gingham dog and the calico cat Side by side on the table sat;
'Twas half-past twelve, and (what do you think! )
Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!
The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate Appeared to know as sure as fate There was going to be a terrible spat.
( I wasn't there; Isimply state
What was told me by the Chinese plate! )
The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"
Andthecalico cat replied "Mee-ow! "
The air was littered, an hour or so,
With bits of gingham and calico,
While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place
Up with its hands before its face,
For it always dreaded a family row!
(Now mind: I'm only telling you What the old Dutch clock declares is true!)
