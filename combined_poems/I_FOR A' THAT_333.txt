I
FOR A' THAT
By Robert Burns
S there, for honest poverty,
That hangs his head, and a' that?
The coward slave, we pass him by,
Wedare be poor for a' that ;
For a' that, and a' that,
Our toils obscure, and a' that;
The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
The man's the gowd for a' that!
What though onhamely fare we dine,
Wearhoddin-gray,' and a' that;
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,
Aman's a man for a' that!
For a' that, and a' that,
Their tinsel show, and a' that;
Thehonest man, though e'er sae poor,
Is king o' men for a' that !
Ye see yon birkie ca'd alord,
Wha struts, and stares, and a' that;
Though hundreds worship at his word,
He's but a coof for a' that;
Coarse woolen clothes. * Impudent fellow. Fool, blockhead.
