THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
It said unto the forest, "Shout!
Hang all your leafy banners out! "
It touched the wood-bird's folded wing,
And said, "O bird, awake and sing!"
And o'er the farms, "O chanticleer,
Your clarion blow; the day is near!"
It whispered to the fields of corn,
"Bow down, and hail the coming morn! "
It shouted through the belfry-tower,
"Awake, Obell! proclaim the hour."
It crossed the churchyard with a sigh,
Andsaid, "Not yet! in quiet lie."


THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
By Edward Fitzgerald
'T
IS adull sight To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing :
Sighing, oh ! sighing :
When such a time cometh,
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire :
Oh, pile a bright fire!


THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings- Oh, drearily sings !
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast :
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry- Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth- How ' twas gladsome, but often Foolish, forsooth :
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or to get merry We sing some old rhyme,
That made the wood ring again In summer timeSweet summer time!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrilySo merrily !

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
And ere to bed
Gowe, go we,
Down on the ashes
Wekneel on the knee,
Praying together !
Thus, then, live I,
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By heaven! the bold sun Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green,
Ijump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!
HIAWATHA'S SAILING
By Henry W. Longfellow
"GIVEme IVE me of your bark, OBirchtree!
â˜‘ Of your yellow bark, OBirch tree !
Growing by the rushing river,
Tall and stately in the valley!
I a light canoe will build me,
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
That shall float upon the river,
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily !
"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch tree!
Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,
For the summer-time is coming,
And the sun is warm in heaven,
And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
In the solitary forest,
When the birds were singing gaily,
In the moon of leaves were singing,
And the Sun, from sleep awaking,
Started up and said, "Behold me!
Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
And the tree with all its branches
Rustled in the breeze of morning,
Saying, with a sigh of patience,
"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha! "
With his knife the tree he girdled;
Just beneath its lowest branches,
Just above the roots, he cut it,
Till the sap came oozing outward;
Down the trunk, from top to bottom,
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,
With awooden wedge he raised it,
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!
Of your strong and pliant branches,
My canoe to make more steady,
Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
Through the summit of the cedar
Went a sound, acry of horror,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
Went a murmur of resistance ;
But it whispered, bending downward,
"Take my boughs, O Hiawatha! "
Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,
Shaped them straightway to a framework,
Like two bows he formed and shaped them,
Like two bended bows together.
"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!
Of your fibrous roots, O Larch tree!
My canoe to bind together.
So to bind the ends together That the water may not enter,
That the river may not wet me! "
And the larch, with all its fibers,
Shivered in the air of morning,
Touched his forehead with its tassels,
Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,
"Take them all, O Hiawatha ! "
From the earth he tore the fibers,
Tore the tough roots of the larch tree,
Closely sewed the bark together,
Bound it closely to the framework.
"Give me of your balm, O Fir tree !
Of your balsam and your resin,
So to close the seams together
That the water may not enter,
That the river may not wet me!"
And the fir tree, tall and somber,
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,
Rattled like a shore with pebbles,
Answered wailing, answered weeping,
"Take my balm, O Hiawatha! "
Andhe took the tears of balsam,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
Took the resin of the fir tree,
Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,
Made each crevice safe from water.
"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!
I will make a necklace of them,
Make a girdle for my beauty,
And two stars to deck her bosom!"
From a hollow tree the hedgehog
With his sleepy eyes looked at him,
Shot his shining quills, like arrows,
Saying, with a drowsy murmur,
Through the tangle of his whiskers,
"Take my quills, O Hiawatha! "
From the ground the quills he gathered,
All the little shining arrows,
Stained them red and blue and yellow,
With the juice of roots and berries ;
Into his canoe he wrought them,
Round its waist a shining girdle,
Round its bows agleaming necklace,
On its breast two stars resplendent.
Thus the birch canoe was builded
In the valley, by the river,
In the bosom of the forest ;
And the forest's life was in it,
All its mystery and its magic,
All the lightness of the birch tree,
All the toughness of the cedar,
All the larch's supple sinew;
And it floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily.
