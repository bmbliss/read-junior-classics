THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest points of war,
Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry
of Navarre.
Ho! maidens of Vienna; Ho! matrons of Lucerne;
Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.
Ho! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your
Ho! burghers of St. Genevieve, keep watch and
arms be bright ;
ward to-night.
For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our Godhath
raised the slave,
And mocked the counsel of the wise, the valour of
the brave.
Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories
are;
Andglory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of
Navarre.
