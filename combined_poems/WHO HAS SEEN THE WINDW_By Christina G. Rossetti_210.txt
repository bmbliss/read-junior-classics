WHO HAS SEEN THE WINDW
By Christina G. Rossetti
HO has seen the wind?
Neither I nor you:
But when the leaves hang trembling,
The wind is passing through.
Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor I:
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by.
WIND-SONG
By Nora Hopper
BLOWmerry- , blow, winds blow,braggartwinds and
Blow down the almond snow, toss the flowering
cherry.
Daffodils ablow, arow, mingle intheir dances,
Shake the purple flags that grow tall amid their
lances.
Blow, O winds blow, strip the winter-berry!
