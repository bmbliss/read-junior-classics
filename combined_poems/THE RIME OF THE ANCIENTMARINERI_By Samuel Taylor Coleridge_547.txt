THE ANCIENT MARINER
The salt sea was frozen on her breast,
The salt tears in her eyes ;
Andhe saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,
On the billows fall and rise.
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus In the midnight and the snow!
Christ save us all from a death like this
On the reef of Norman's Woe!


THE RIME OF THE ANCIENTMARINERI
