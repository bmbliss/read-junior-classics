FATHERLAND
Sea-fights and land-fights, grimandgreat,
Fought to make and to save the State :
Weary marches and sinking ships ;
Cheers of victory on dying lips ;
Days of plenty and years of peace;
March of a strong land's swift increase ;
Equal justice, right, and law,
Stately honor and reverend awe;
Sign of a nation, great and strong Toward her people from foreign wrong:
Pride and glory and honor-all Live in the colors to stand or fall.
Hats off!
Along the street there comes
Ablare of bugles, a ruffle of drums ;
And loyal hearts are beating high :
Hats off!
The flag is passing by!

REATHES there the man, with soul
dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned
From wandering on aforeign strand?
If such there breathe, go mark him well:

And, doubly dying, shall go down To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.
