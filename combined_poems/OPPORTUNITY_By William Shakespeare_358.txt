OPPORTUNITY
By William Shakespeare
HERE is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to
fortune ;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows, and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
-From "Julius Cæsar."
