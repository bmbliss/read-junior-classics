SEVEN TIMES FOUR
Ha! many a foliaged guardian of the height,
Majestic pine or chestnut, riven and bare,
Falls in the rage of that aerial flight,
Led by the Prince of all the Powers of air!
Vast boughs like shattered banners hurtling fly
Down the thick tumult; while, like emerald snow,
Millions of orphaned leaves make wild the sky,
Or drift in shuddering helplessness below.
Still, still, the levelled lances of the rain
At earth's half-shielded breast take glittering
aim;
All space is rife with fury, racked with pain,
Earth bathed in vapor, and heaven rent by flame !
At last the cloud battalions through long rifts Of luminous mists retire:-the strife is done,
And earth once more her wounded beauty lifts,
To meet the healing kisses of the sun.


HSEVEN TIMES FOUR
By Jean Ingelow
EIGH-HO! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tall!
Whenthe wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses,
Anddance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small!
Here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own
lasses,
Eager to gather them all.
