THE MAN IN THE MOON
Andin twenty years they all came back- In twenty years or more ;
And every one said, "How tall they've grown!
For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible
Zone,
And the hills of the Chankly Bore."
And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast ;
And every one said, "If we only live,
We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,
To the hills of the Chankly Bore."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.

Eyes !

What a singular thing!
Iknow! but these facts are authentic, mydear- There's a boil onhis ear; and a corn on his chinHe calls it a dimple-but dimples stick in; -
Yet it might be a dimple turned over, you know!
Whang!
Ho!
Why, certainly so!-
It might be a dimple turned over, you know!
"And The Manin the Moon has a rheumatic kneeGee!
Whizz!
What a pity that is!
And his toes have worked round where his heels
