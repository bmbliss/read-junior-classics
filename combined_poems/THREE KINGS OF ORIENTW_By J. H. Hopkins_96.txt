THREE KINGS OF ORIENT
Awink of his eye, and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a
jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Andgiving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
Andawaythey all flew like the down of a thistle ;
But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all agood-night !"


THREE KINGS OF ORIENTW
By J. H. Hopkins
E three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder Star.
Born a babe on Bethlehem plain,
Gold we bring to crown him again;
King for ever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.
