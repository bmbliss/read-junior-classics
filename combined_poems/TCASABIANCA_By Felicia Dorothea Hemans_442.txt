TCASABIANCA
By Felicia Dorothea Hemans
THE boy stood on the burning deck Whence all but he had fled ;
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
Shone round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm ;
Acreature of heroic blood,
A proud, though child-like form.
The flames rolled on-he would not go
Without his father's word ;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.
He called aloud, "Say, father, say,
If yet my task is done ? "
He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son.
" Speak, father ! " once again he cried,
" If I may yet be gone ! "
And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on.
Upon his brow he felt their breath,
And in his waving hair,
And looked from that lone post of death
In still, yet brave despair ;
