THE FROST
And oh, the spring-the spring!
I lead the life of a king!
Couch'd in the teeming grass,
I spy each pretty lass.
I look where no one dares,
And I stare where no one stares,
And when the night is nigh,
Lambs bleat my lullaby.


TTHE FROST
By Hannah Flagg Gould
HE Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,
Andwhispered, "Now I shall be out of sight ;
So through the valley and over the height,
In silence I'll take my way:
I will not go on with that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,
But I'll be as busy as they."
Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its
crest;
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed In diamond beads-and over the breast
Of the quivering lake he spread
Acoat of mail, that it need not fear
The downward point of many a spear
That hung on its margin far andnear,
Where a rock could rear its head.
