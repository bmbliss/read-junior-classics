THE ANCIENT MARINER
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow!
Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:
Then all averred, I had killed the bird
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,
That bring the fog and mist.
The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free;
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.
Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be ;
And we did speak only to break The silence of the sea !
All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.
Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean.
Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor anydrop to drink.


THE ANCIENT MARINER
The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.
About, about, in reel and rout
The death- fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.
And some in dreams assur√®d were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so,
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.
Andevery tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root ;
We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot.
Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.
