THE HOUSEKEEPER
Says the ant to the cricket, "I'm your servant and
friend,
But we ants never borrow, we ants never lend;
But tell me, dear sir, did you lay nothing by When the weather was warm?" Said the cricket,
Not I.
My heart is so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay"-
"You sang, sir, you say?
Gothen," said the ant, "and dance winter away."
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Though this is afable, the moral is good:
If you live without work, you must live without food.


TTHE HOUSEKEEPER
By Charles Lamb
HE frugal snail, with forecast of repose,
Carries his house with him where'er he goes ;
Peeps out-and if there comes a shower of rain,
Retreats to his small domicile again.
Touch but a tip of him, a horn-'tis wellHe curls up inhis sanctuary Shell,
He's his own landlord, his own tenant; stay
Long as he will, he dreads no Quarter Day.
Himself he boards and lodges; both invites And feasts himself; sleeps with himself o' nights
