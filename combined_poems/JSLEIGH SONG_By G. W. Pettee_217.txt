SLEIGH SONG
Slowly she grew-till she filled the night,
And shone
On her throne
In the sky alone,
Amatchless, wonderful, silvery light,
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.
Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I !
With mybreath,
Ingood faith,
I blew her to death!
First blew her away right out of the sky,
Then blew her in: what a strength am I!"
But the Moon she knew naught of the silly affair;
For, high In the sky,
With her one white eye,
Motionless miles above the air,
She never had heard the great Windblare.


JSLEIGH SONG
By G. W. Pettee
INGLE, jingle, clear the way,
'Tis the merry, merry sleigh,
As it swiftly scuds along
Hear the burst of happy song,
See the gleam of glances bright,
Flashing o'er the pathway white.
Jingle, jingle, past it flies,

COME, LITTLE LEAVES
Sending shafts from hooded eyes,
Roguish archers, I'll be bound,
Little heeding who they wound;
See them, with capricious pranks,
Ploughing now the drifted banks;
Jingle, jingle, mid the glee
Who among them cares for me?
Jingle, jingle, on they go,
Capes and bonnets white with snow,
Not a single robe they fold To protect them from the cold;
Jingle, jingle, mid the storm,
Fun and frolic keep them warm;
Jingle, jingle, down the hills,
O'er the meadows, past the mills,
Now 'tis slow, and now 'tis fast;
Winter will not always last.
Jingle, jingle, clear the way,
'Tis the merry, merry sleigh.
COME, LITTLE LEAVES
"COME,
ByGeorge Cooper
OME, little Leaves," said the Wind one day,
"Come over the meadows with me and play;
Put on your dresses of red and gold,
For summer is gone and the days grow cold."
Soon as the Leaves heard the Wind's loud call,
Down they came fluttering, one and all;
Over the brown fields they danced and flew,
Singing the sweet little song they knew:
