GOD REST YE
We took a saw and several nails,
Andwater in the nursery pails ;
And Tom said, "Let us also take
An apple and a slice of cake;"_
Which was enough for Tom and me
To go a-sailing on, till tea.
We sailed along for days and days,
Andhad the very best of plays ;
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
So there was no one left but me.
GOD REST YE, MERRY GENTLEMEN
By Dinah Maria Mulock
OD rest ye, merry gentlemen; let nothing you â˜‘ dismay,
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
The dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone
through the gray,
When Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on
Christmas-day.
God rest ye, little children; let nothing you
affright,
For Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;
Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping
lay,
When Christ, the child of Nazareth, was born on
Christmas-day.
