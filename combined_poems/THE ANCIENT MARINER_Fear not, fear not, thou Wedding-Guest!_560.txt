THE ANCIENT MARINER
Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!
This body dropt not down.
Alone, alone, all, all alone,
Alone on a wide wide sea!
And never a saint took pity on My soul in agony.
The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie :
And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on; and so did I.
I looked upon the rotting sea,
And drew my eyes away;
I looked upon the rotting deck,
And there the dead men lay.
I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
Awicked whisper came, and made
Myheart as dry as dust.
I closed my lids, and kept them close,
And the balls like pulses beat ;
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky Lay like a load onmyweary eye,
And the dead were at my feet.
The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
Nor rot nor reek did they :
The look with which they looked on me
Had never passed away.


THE ANCIENT MARINER
An orphan's curse would drag to hell Aspirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is the curse in adead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.
The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide :
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two besideHer beams bemocked the sultry main,
Like April hoar-frost spread;
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
Astill and awful red.
Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes :
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes.
Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire :
Blue glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire.
Ohappy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare :
Aspring of love gushed from myheart,
And I blessed them unaware:


THE ANCIENT MARINER
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I blessed them unaware.
The selfsame moment I could pray;
And from my neck so free
The Albatross fell off, and sank
Like lead into the sea.
