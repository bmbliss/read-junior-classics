THE OWL
"I trod the park with a princely air,
I filled my crop with the richest fare;
Icawed all day 'mid alordly crew,
And I made more noise in the world than you!
The sun shone forth on my ebon wing;
I looked and wondered-good-night, poor thing!"
"Good night, once more," said the lark's sweet voice.
"I see no cause to repent my choice ;
You build your nest in the lofty pine,
But is your slumber more sweet than mine?
You make more noise in the world than I,
But whose is the sweeter minstrelsy?"


THE OWL
By Alfred Tennyson
HEN cats run home and light is cold upon the ground,
And the far-off stream is dumb,
And the whirring sail goes round,
And the whirring sail goes round;
Alone and warming his five wits,
The white owl in the belfry sits .
conce,
When merry milkmaids click the latch,
And rarely smells the new-mown hay,
And the cock hath sung beneath the thatch Twice or thrice his roundelay,
Twice or thrice his roundelay ;
Alone and warming his five wits,
The white owl in the belfry sits.
