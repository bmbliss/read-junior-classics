OLD IRONSIDEST
What of the shaft?
The shaft was cut in England:
Along shaft, a strong shaft,
Barbed and trim and true ;
So we'll drink all together
To the gray goose feather,
And the land where the gray goose flew.
What of the men?
The men were bred in England:
The bowman-the yeomanThe lads of dale and fell.
Here's to you and to you!
To the hearts that are true
And the land where the true hearts dwell.


OLD IRONSIDES
By Oliver Wendell Holmes
HE mast that Britain strove to bow in vain;
And one who listened to the tale of shame,
Whose heart still answered to that sacred name,
Whose eye still followed o'er his country's tides Thy glorious flag, our brave Old Ironsides !
From yon lone attic, in a summer's morn,
Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn.
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
Andmany an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon's roar;-
