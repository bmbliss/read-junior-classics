A LOBSTER QUADRILLE
God rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed
morn
The Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:
Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.


A LOBSTER QUADRILLE
By Lewis Carroll
"WILLyouwalkalittle faster?" said awhit-
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's tread- ing on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won'tyou, won't you join the dance?
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
Whenthey take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askanceSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
