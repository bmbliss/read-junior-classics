THE ARROW AND THE SONG
With such a comrade, such a friend,
I fain would walk till journey's end,
Through summer sunshine, winter rain,
Andthen?-Farewell, we shall meet again!
HARK, HARK! THE LARK!
By William Shakespeare
[ARK, hark! the lark at heaven's gates Hsings,
And Phœbus 'gins arise,
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
And winking Mary-buds begin To ope their golden eyes;
With everything that pretty is,
My lady sweet, arise :
Arise, arise.


THE ARROW AND THE SONG
By Henry W. Longfellow
