THE ARAB TO HIS FAVORITESTEED
By Caroline E. Norton
Y beautiful! my
meekly by,
beautiful! that standest
dark and fiery eye,
With thy proudly arched and glossy neck, and
Fret not to roam the desert now, with all thy
wingéd speed;
Imay not mount on thee again-thou'rt sold, my Arab steed!
Fret not with that impatient hoof-snuff not the breezy wind- The farther that thou fliest now, so far am I behind;
The stranger hath thy bridle-rein-thy master hath his goldFleet-limbed and beautiful, farewell; thou'rt sold,
my steed, thou'rt sold.
Farewell! those free, untiréd limbs full many amile
must roam,
To reach the chill and wintry sky which clouds the stranger's home;
Some other hand, less fond, must now thy corn and
bed prepare,
Thy silky mane, I braided once, must be another's care!
The morning sun shall dawn again, but never more with thee
Shall I gallop through the desert paths, where we
were wont to be ;
