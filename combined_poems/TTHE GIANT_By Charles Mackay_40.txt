THE GIANT
Onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the
moon,
Rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon,
Rumblin' , tumblin', roun' about, crowin' like a
cock,
Skirlin' like a kenna-what-wauknin' sleepin' folk.
Hey, Willie Winkie! the wean's in a creel!
Waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel,
Ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her
thrumsHey, Willie Winkie!-See, there he comes!
Wearie is the mither that has a storie wean,
Awee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane,
That has a battle aye wi' sleep before he'll close an
ee;
But a kiss frae aff his rosy lips gies strength anew
to me.


TTHE GIANT
By Charles Mackay
HERE came a Giant to my door,
AGiant fierce and strong;
His step was heavy on the floor,
His arms were ten yards long.
He scowled and frowned; he shook the
ground;
I trembled through and through;
At length I looked him in the face And cried, "Who cares for you?"

MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
The mighty Giant, as I spoke,
Grewpale and thin and small,
And through his body, as 'twere smoke,
I saw the sunshine fall.
His blood- red eyes turned blue as skies;-
"Is this," I cried, with growing pride,
"Is this the mighty foe?"
:
He sank before my earnest face,
He vanished quite away,
Andleft no shadow inhis place Between me and the day.
Such giants come to strike us dumb,
But, weak in every part,
They melt before the strong man's eyes,
Andfly the true of heart.
