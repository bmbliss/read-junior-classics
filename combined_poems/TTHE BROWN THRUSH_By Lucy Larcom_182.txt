THE BROWN THRUSH
Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.
He who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone
Will lead my steps aright.


TTHE BROWN THRUSH
By Lucy Larcom
HERE'S amerry brown thrush sitting up in
the tree-
"He's singing to me! He's singing to me!"
Andwhat does he say, little girl, little boy?
"Oh, the world's running over with joy!
Don't you hear? don't you see?
Hush! Look! In my tree,
I'm as happy as happy can be!"
And the brown thrush keeps singing, "Anest do
you see,
And five eggs hid by mein the juniper-tree?
Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,
Or the world will lose some of its joy!
Now I'm glad! now I'm free!
And I always shall be,
If you never bring sorrow to me."
