BLOCK CITY
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
Andsees before him, dale andplain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.


BLOCK CITY
By Robert Louis Stevenson
:
WHATHATare you able to build with your blocks?
Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
Rain maykeep raining, and others go roam,
But I can be happy and building at home.
Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,
There I'll establish a city for me:
Akirk and a mill and apalace beside,
And aharbor as well where my vessels may ride.
Great is the palace with pillar andwall,
Asort of a tower on the top of it all,
And steps coming down in an orderly way !
To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.
This one is sailing and that one is moored:
Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings
Coming and going with presents and things !
Now I have done with it, down let it go!
All in amoment the town is laid low.
Block upon block lying scattered and free,
What is there left of my town by the sea?
