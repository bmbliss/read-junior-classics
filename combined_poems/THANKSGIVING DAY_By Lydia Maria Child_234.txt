THANKSGIVING DAY
Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,
Every morn shall lead thee through Fresh baptisms of the dew;
Every evening from thy feet
Shall the cool wind kiss the heat :
All too soon these feet must hide
In the prison cells of pride,
Lose the freedom of the sod,
Like a colt's for work be shod,
Made to tread the mills of toil,
Up and down in ceaseless moil :
Happy if their track be found Never on forbidden ground ;
Happy if they sink not in Quick and treacherous sands of sin,
Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,
Ere it passes, barefoot boy !


THANKSGIVING DAY
By Lydia Maria Child
VER the river and through the wood,
To grandfather's house we go;
The horse knows the way
To carry the sleigh
Through the white and drifted snow,
Over the river and through the wood- Oh, how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes,
And bites the nose,
As over the ground we go.

THE SWAN'S NEST
:
Over the river and through the wood,
To have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring,
"Ting-a-ling-ding! "
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day !
Over the river and through the wood Trot fast, mydapple-gray!
Spring over the ground,
Like a hunting-hound!
For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river and through the wood,
And straight through the barnyard gate.
Weseem to go Extremely slowIt is so hard to wait !
Over the river and through the woodNow grandmother's cap I spy !
Hurrah for the fun!
Is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!
