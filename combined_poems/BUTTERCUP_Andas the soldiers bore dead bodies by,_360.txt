BUTTERCUP
Andas the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms Hequestioned me; amongst the rest, demanded My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting, with my wounds being cold,
To be so pester'd with apopinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience,
Answer'd neglectingly, I know not whatHe should, or he should not; for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,
Of guns, and drums, and wounds-God save the mark!-
Andtelling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.
