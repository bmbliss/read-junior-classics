THE LOST DOLL
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an indiarubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
Andcanonlymake afool of me in everysort ofway.
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you
can see ;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow
sticks to me!
One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepyhead,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep
inbed.


THE LOST DOLL
By Charles Kingsley
IONCE The prettiest hadasweet doll little doll, dears,
Her cheeks were so red and white, dears,
And her hair was so charmingly curled.
But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
As I played on the heath one day;
AndI cried for her more than a week, dears,
But I never could find where she lay.
