A STORM IN THE DISTANCE
By Paul H. Hayne
SEE the cloud-born squadrons of the gale,
Their lines of rain like glittering spears
deprest,
While all the affrighted land grows darkly pale
In flashing charge on earth's half-shielded breast.
Sounds like the rush of trampling columns float
From that fierce conflict ; volleyed thunders peal,
Blent with the maddened wind's wild bugle-note;
The lightnings flash, the solid woodlands reel !
