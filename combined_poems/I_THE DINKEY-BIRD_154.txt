I
THE DINKEY-BIRD
By Eugene Field
N an ocean, 'way out yonder (As all sapient people know) ,
Is the land of Wonder-Wander,
Whither children love to go ;
It's their playing, romping, swinging,
That give great joy to me While the Dinkey-Bird goes singing In the amfalula tree.
There the gumdrops grow like cherries,
And taffy's thick as peas
Caramels you pick like berries
When, and where, and how you please;
Big red sugar-plums are clinging To the cliffs beside that sea
Where the Dinkey-Bird is singing
In the amfalula tree.
So when children shout and scamper And make merry all the day,
When there's naught to put a damper
To the ardor of their play;
