WILLIE WINKIE
Bear through sorrow, wrong, and ruth,
In thy heart the dew of youth,
On thy lips the smile of truth.
O, that dew, like balm, shall steal
Into wounds, that cannot heal,
Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;
And that smile, like sunshine, dart
Into many a sunless heart,
For a smile of God thou art. ::


WILLIE WINKIE
By William Miller
EE WILLIE WINKIE rins through WEELWIL
Up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown,
Tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock,
"Are the weans in their bed?-for it's now ten
o'clock. "
Hey, Willie Winkie! are ye comin' ben?
The cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin'
hen,
The doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a
cheep;
But here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa'
asleep.
