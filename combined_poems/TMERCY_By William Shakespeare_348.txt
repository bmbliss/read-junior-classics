TMERCY
By William Shakespeare
HE quality of mercy is not strained- It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Uponthe place beneath: it is twice blessedIt blesseth him that gives, and him that takes :
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The thronéd monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Werein doth sit the dread and fear of kings :

THE PEDLER'S PACK
But mercy is above this sceptred sway- It is enthronéd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice.
