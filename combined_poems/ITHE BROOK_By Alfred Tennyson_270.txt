ITHE BROOK
By Alfred Tennyson
COME from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally,
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.


THE BROOK

By thirty hills
I hurry down
,
Or slip between the ridges
,
By twenty thorps,
a little town,
And half
a hundred bridges
.
Till last by Philip's farm
I flow To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
I chatter over stony ways
,
In little sharps and trebles,
I bubble into eddying bays
,
I babble on the pebbles
.
With many
a curve my banks
I fret
By many
a field and fallow,
Andmany
a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow
.
I chatter, chatter
, as
I flow
To join the brimming river
,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
Iwind about
, and in and out,
With here
a blossom sailing
,
Andhere and there
a lusty trout,
Andhere and there
agrayling
,
And here and there
a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak
Above the golden gravel,
