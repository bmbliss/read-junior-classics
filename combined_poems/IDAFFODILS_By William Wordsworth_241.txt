DAFFODILS
I love, I love them so my green things growing!
And I think that they love me, without false
showing;
For by many a tender touch, they comfort me so
much,
With the soft mute comfort of green things growing.
A BOY'S PRAYER
By H. C. Beeching
MODwho created me Gâ˜‘ Nimble and light of limb,
In three elements free,
To run, to ride, to swim
Not when the sense is dim,
But now from the heart of joy,
I would remember Him:
Take the thanks of aboy.


IDAFFODILS
By William Wordsworth
WANDERED lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales andhills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils,
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering anddancing in the breeze.


DAFFODIL
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
Apoet could not but be gay In such a jocund company.
Igazed, and gazed, but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought.
For oft, when on my couch I lie Invacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude;
And thenmyheart with pleasure fills,
Anddances with the daffodils.
