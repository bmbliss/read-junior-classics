MAIDENHOOD
Next day Elizabeth Wigglesworth, who always acts so proud,
Said, " Six times nine is fifty-two," and I nearly laughed aloud!
But I wished I hadn't when teacher said, "Now,
Dorothy, tell if you can."
For I thought of my doll and-sakes alive -I!
answered, "Mary Ann! "


MMAIDENHOOD
By Henry W. Longfellow
AIDEN! with the meek, brown eyes,
In whose orbs ashadow lies
Like the dusk in evening skies !
Thou whose locks outshine the sun,
Golden tresses, wreathed in one,
As the braided streamlets run!
Standing, with reluctant feet,
Where the brook and river meet,
Womanhood and childhood fleet !
Gazing, with a timid glance,
Onthe brooklet's swift advance,
On the river's broad expanse!
Deep and still, that gliding stream Beautiful to thee must seem,
As the river of adream.


MAIDENHOOD
Then why pause with indecision,
When bright angels in thy vision
Beckon thee to fields Elysian?
Seest thou shadows sailing by,
As the dove, with startled eye,
Sees the falcon's shadow fly?
Hearest thou voices on the shore,
That our ears perceive no more,
Deafened by the cataract's roar?
O, thou child of many prayers !
Life hath quicksands-Life hath snares!
Care and age come unawares!
Like the swell of some sweet tune,
Morning rises into noon,
Mayglides onward into June.
Childhood is the bough, where slumbered Birds and blossoms many-numbered;-
Age, that bough with snows encumbered.
Gather, then, each flower that grows,
Whenthe young heart overflows,
To embalm that tent of snows.
Bear a lily in thy hand;
Gates of brass cannot withstand
The touch of that magic wand.
