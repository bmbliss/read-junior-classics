THE TIGER
Then came the cowslip Like a dancer in the fair,
She spread her little mat of green,
And on it danced she.
With a fillet bound about her brow,
Afillet round her happy brow,
Agolden fillet round her brow,
And rubies in her hair.


TTHE TIGER
By William Blake
IGER, tiger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes ?
Onwhat wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain ?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
