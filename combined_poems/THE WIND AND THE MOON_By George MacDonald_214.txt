THE WIND AND THE MOON
Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
And ships are tossed at sea,
By, on the highway, low and loud,
By at the gallop goes he.
By at the gallop he goes, and then
By he comes back at the gallop again.


THE WIND AND THE MOON
By George MacDonald
AID the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out!
You stare
In the air
As if crying 'Beware,'
Always looking what I am about :
I hate to be watched; I will blow you out !
The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.
So, deep
On a heap
Of clouds, to sleep,
Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon,
Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon!"
He turned in his bed: she was there again!
Onhigh
In the sky,
With her one ghost-eye The Moon shone white and alive and plain:
Said the Wind, "I will blow you out again!"


THE WIND AND THE MOON
The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew slim.
"With my sledge
And my wedge
I have knocked off her edge !
Iwill blow," said the Wind, "right fierce and grim,
And the creature will soon be slimmer than slim!"
He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.
"One puff
More's enough
To blow her to snuff !
One good puff more where the last was bred,
Andglimmer, glimmer, glum will go that thread!"
Heblew a great blast, and the thread wasgone.
In the air
Nowhere
Was a moonbeam bare ;
Larger and nearer the shy stars shone :
Sure and certain the Moon was gone!
The Wind he took to his revels once more ;
On down
Andin town,
A merry-mad clown,
He leaped and holloed with whistle and roarWhenthere was that glimmering thread once more!
He flew in a rage-he danced and blew ;
But in vain
Was the pain
Of his bursting brain,
For still the Moon-scrap the broader grew
The more that he swelled his big cheeks andblew.
