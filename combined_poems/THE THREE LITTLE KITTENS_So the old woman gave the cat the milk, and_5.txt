THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS
So the old woman gave the cat the milk, and
when she had lapped up the milkThe cat began to kill the rat ;
The rat began to gnaw the rope;
The rope began to hang the butcher ;
The butcher began to kill the ox;
The ox began to drink the water ;
The water began to quench the fire ;
The fire began to burn the stick ;
The stick began to beat the dog;
The dog began to bite the pig ;
The pig jumped over the stile,
And so the old woman got home that night.


THE THREE LITTLE KITTENST
Anonymous
HREE little kittens lost their mittens;
And they began to cry,
O mother dear,
Wevery much fear That we have lost our mittens.
Lost your mittens !
You naughty kittens !
Then you shall have no pie.
Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow.
No, you shall have no pie.
