THE SWING
Ifound my poor little doll, dears,
As I played on the heath oneday;
Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
For her paint is all washed away,
Andher arms trodden off by the cows, dears,
Andher hair not the least bit curled;
Yet for old sakes' sake, she is still, dears,
The prettiest doll inthe world.
