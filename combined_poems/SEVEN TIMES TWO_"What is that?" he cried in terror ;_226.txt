SEVEN TIMES TWO
"What is that?" he cried in terror ;
"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"
And the good Nokomis answered:
"That is but the owl and owlet,
Talking in their native language,
Talking, scolding at each other."
Then the little Hiawatha
Learned of every bird its language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How they built their nests in summer,
Where they hid themselves in winter,
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."
Of all beasts he learned the language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How the beavers built their lodges,
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,
Why the rabbit was so timid,
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers. "


YSEVEN TIMES TWO
ON bells
By Jean Ingelow
in the steeple, ring out your changes,
How many soever they be,
Andlet the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges
Come over, come over to me.


SEVEN TIMES TWO
Yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling No magical sense conveys,
Andbells have forgotten their old art of telling
The fortune of future days.
" Turn again, turn again, " once they rang cheerily While a boy listened alone :
Made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily
All by himself on a stone.
Poor bells ! I forgive you; your good days are over,
Andmine, they are yet to be;
No listening, no longing, shall aught, aught discover:
You leave the story to me.
The foxglove shoots out of the green matted
heather,
Preparing her hoods of snow;
She was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather:
O, children take long to grow.
I wish, and I wish, that the spring would go
faster,
Nor long summer bide so late ;
AndI could grow on like the foxglove and aster,
For some things are ill to wait.
I wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover,
While dear hands are laid on my head;
"The child is a woman, the book may close only,
For all the lessons are said."
