GREPUTATION
By William Shakespeare
MOOD name in man or woman, dear my lord,
â˜‘ Is the immediate jewel of their souls :
Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something,
nothing;
'Twasmine, 'tishis, and has been slave to thousands ;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
-From " Othello."
OVER HILL, OVER DALE
By William Shakespeare
VER hill, over dale,
through brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green:
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
