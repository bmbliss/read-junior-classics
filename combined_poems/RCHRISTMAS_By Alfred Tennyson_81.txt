CHRISTMAS
So, when my nurse comes in for me,
Home I return across the sea,
And go to bed with backward looks At mydear land of Story-books.


RCHRISTMAS
By Alfred Tennyson
ING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light :
The year is dying in the night- Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new- Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
The year is going, let him go ;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress for all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife;
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
The faithless coldness of the times:
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
