THE FAIRY FOLK
No flower bells that expand and shrink Gleamhalf so heavenly sweet,
As shine on life's untrodden brinkAbaby's feet.


THE FAIRY FOLK
By William Allingham
UPP the airy mountain,
Down the rushy glen,
We daren't go a-hunting,
For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together ;
Green jacket, red cap,
Andwhite owl's feather.
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home,
They live on crispy pancakes
Of yellow tide-foam;
Some in the reeds
Of the black mountain-lake,
With frogs for their watch-dogs,
All night awake.
High on the hill-top The old King sits ;
He is now so old and gray He's nigh lost his wits.


THE FAIRY FOLK
:
With
a bridge of white mist Columbkill he crosses,
Onhis stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses
;
Or going up with music
,
On cold starry nights
,
To sup with the Queen
Of the gay Northern Lights
.
They stole little Bridget For seven years long;
When she came down again
Her friends were all gone.
They took her lightly back Between the night and morrow
;
They thought that she was fast asleep
,
But she was dead with sorrow
.
They have kept her ever since
Deep within the lakes
,
On
abed of flag leaves
,
Watching till she wakes.
By the craggy hill-side,
Through the mosses bare
,
They have planted thorn trees
For pleasure here and there
.
Isanymanso daring
As dig one up in spite
?
He shall find the thornies set
Inhis bed at night.
Upthe airy mountain,
Down the rushyglen,

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
We daren't go a-hunting For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together;
Green jacket, red cap,
And white owl's feather.
