A SONG OF CLOVER
And the sturdy blackthorn spray
Keeps his silver for the May;-
Coming when no flowerets would,
Save thy lowly sisterhood,
Early violets, blue and white,
Dying for their love of light.
Almond blossom, sent to teach us
That the spring days soon will reach us,
Lest, with longing over-tried,
We die as the violets diedBlossom, clouding all the tree With thy crimson broidery,
Long before a leaf of green On the bravest bough is seenAh! when winter winds are swinging
All thy red bells into ringing,
With a bee in every bell,
Almond bloom, we greet thee well.


IA SONG OF CLOVER
By Saxe Holm
WONDER what the Clover thinks,
Intimate friend of Bob-o' -links,
Lover of Daisies slim and white,
Waltzer with Buttercups at night ;
Keeper of Inn for travelling Bees,
Serving to them wine-dregs and lees,
Left by the Royal Humming Birds,
Who sip and pay with fine-spun words;
