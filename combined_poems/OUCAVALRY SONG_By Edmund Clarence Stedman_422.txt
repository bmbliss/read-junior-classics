CAVALRY SONG
Dear Canada! for thee our fathers wrought,
Thy good and ours unselfishly they sought.
With steadfast hand and fearless mind
They felled the forest domes,
Content at last to leave behind
Aheritage of homes.
Lord God of Hosts! we now implore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore.
Blest Canada! the homeland that we love.
Thy freedom came a gift from God above.
Thy righteous laws, thy justice fair,
Give matchless liberty ;
We thank our God that we may share
Thy glorious destiny.
Lord God of Hosts ! we now implore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore.

Now, cling! clang! forward all,
Into the fight!
;

LIFE-MASK OF LINCOLN
Dash on beneath the smoking dome:
Through level lightnings gallop nearer!
One look to Heaven! No thoughts of home:

Cling! clang! forward all!
Heaven help those whose horses fall:
Cut left and right!
They flee before our fierce attack!
They fall! they spread in broken surges.
Now, comrades, bear our wounded back,
And leave the foeman to his dirges.
WHEEL!
The bugles sound the swift recall :
Cling! clang! backward all!
Home, and good night!
ON THE LIFE-MASK OF
