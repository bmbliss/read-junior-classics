A SEA SONG
When the stars threw down their spears,
And water'd heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see ?
Did He who made the lamb make thee ?
Tiger, tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?


AA SEA SONG
By Allan Cunningham
WET sheet and a flowing sea,
Awind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail Andbends the gallant mast ;
And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While, like the eagle free,
Away the good ship flies, and leaves
Old England on the lee.
"Ofor a soft and gentle wind! "
I heard a fair one cry ;
But give to me the snoring breeze And white waves heaving high ;
And white waves heaving high, my lads,
The good ship tight and free- The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.
