A GOOD PLAY
Andeverybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
"See! the Table and the Chair !
Have come out to take the air !"
But in going down an alley,
To a castle in a valley,
They completely lost their way,
Andwandered all the day;
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.
Then they whispered to each other,
"O delightful little brother,
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon."
So the Ducky and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds.


A GOOD PLAY
By Robert Louis Stevenson
TEbuilt W
a ship upon the stairs All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
And filled it full of sofa pillows
To go a-sailing on the billows.
