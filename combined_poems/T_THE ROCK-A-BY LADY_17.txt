T
THE ROCK-A-BY LADY
By Eugene Field
HE Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street Comes stealing; comes creeping;
The poppies they hang from her head to her
feet,
And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleetShe bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
When she findeth you sleeping!
There is one little dream of a beautiful drum-
"Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
There is one little dream of abig sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that bloweth !
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing;
Andboats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams,
And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!
