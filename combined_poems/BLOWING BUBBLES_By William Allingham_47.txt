BLOWING BUBBLES
Once or twice though you should fail,
Try again;
If you would at last prevail,
Try again.
If we strive, 'tis no disgrace Though we may not win the race;
What should you do in that case?
Try again.
Ifyou find your task is hard,
Try again;
Timewill bring you your reward,
Try again.
All that other folks can do,
With your patience should not you?
Only keep this rule in view- Try again.


BLOWING BUBBLES

SEE, the prettyplanet! Floating sphere !
Faintest breeze will fan it
Far or near;
World as light as feather;
Moonshine rays,
Rainbow tints together,
As it plays ;
