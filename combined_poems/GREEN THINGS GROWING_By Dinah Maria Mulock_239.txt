GREEN THINGS GROWING
Look around thee, look around!
Flowers in all the fields abound:
Every running stream is bright ;
All the orchard trees are white;
And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit.
Turn thine eyes to earth and heaven:
God for thee the spring has given,
Taught the birds their melodies,
Clothed the earth and cleared the skies
For thy pleasure or thy food;
Pour thy soul in gratitude.

GREEN THINGS GROWING
By Dinah Maria Mulock
H, the green things growing, the green things growing,
The faint sweet smell of the green things growing!
I should like to live, whether I smile or grieve,
Just to watch the happy life of my green things
growing.
Oh, the fluttering and the pattering of those green things growing!
How they talk each to each, when none of us are
knowing;
In the wonderful white of the weird moonlight
Or the dim dreamy dawn when the cocks are crowing.
