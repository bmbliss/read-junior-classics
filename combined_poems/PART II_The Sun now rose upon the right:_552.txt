PART II
The Sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.
And the good south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariners' hollo!
And I had done ahellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.
