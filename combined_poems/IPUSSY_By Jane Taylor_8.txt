PUSSY
The three little kittens found their mittens,
And they began to cry,
O mother dear,
See here, see here ;
See, we have found our mittens.
What, found your mittens,
You darling kittens,
Then you shall have some pie.
Purr-r, purr-r,
Then you shall have some pie.

IPUSSY
By Jane Taylor
LIKE little Pussy, her coat is so warm,
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm;
So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
ButPussy and I very gently will play;
She shall sit by my side, and I'll give her some
food;
And she'll love me, because I am gentle and good.
I'll pat little Pussy, and then she will purr,
Andthus show her thanks for my kindness to her;
I'll not pinch her ears, nor tread on her paw,
Lest I should provoke her to use her sharp claw;
I never will vex her, nor make her displeased,
For Pussy don't like to be worried or teased.
