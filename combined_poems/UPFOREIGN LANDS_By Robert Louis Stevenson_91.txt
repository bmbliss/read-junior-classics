FOREIGN LANDS
When, to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap,
The cold wind burns my face, and blows
Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod;
Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
And tree and house, and hill and lake,
Are frosted like a wedding-cake.


UPFOREIGN LANDS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
Pinto the cherry tree,
Who should climb but little me?
Iheld the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad onforeign lands.
I saw the next-door garden lie,
Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before.
I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky's blue looking-glass ;
The dusty roads go up and down
With people tramping in to town.
If I could find ahigher tree,
Further and further I should see,
To where the grown-up river slips Into the sea among the ships ;

THE OWL AND THE PUSSY- CAT
To where the roads on either hand
Lead onward into fairy land,
Where all the children dine at five,
Andall the playthings come alive.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT
