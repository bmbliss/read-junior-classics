HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD
NEWS FROM GHENT TO ΑΙΧI
By Robert Browning
SPRANG to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three ;
"Good speed!" cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew;
" Speed! " echoed the wall to us galloping through ;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
