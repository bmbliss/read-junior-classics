AFTER BLENHEIM
When the goodman mends his armor,
And trims his helmet's plume ;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom;
With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.


ITAFTER BLENHEIM
By Robert Southey
T was a summer evening ;
Old Kaspar's work was done,
And he before his cottage door
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round Which he beside the rivulet
In playing there had found;
He came to ask what he had found
That was so large and smooth and round.
Old Kaspar took it from the boy,
Who stood expectant by;
And then the old man shook his head,
And with a natural sigh "'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,
"Who fell in the great victory.


AFTER BLENHEIM
"I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;
And often when I go to plow The plowshare turns them out.
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory."
"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"
Young Peterkin he cries ;
And little Wilhelmine looks up With wonder-waiting eyes ;
"Now tell us all about the war,
Andwhat they fought each other for?"
"It was the English," Kaspar cried,
"Who put the French to rout;
But what they fought each other for I could not well make out.
But everybody said," quoth he,
"That 'twas a famous victory.
"My father lived at Blenheim then,
Yon little stream hard by ;
They burned his dwelling to the ground,
Andhe was forced to fly:
So with his wife and child he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.
"With fire and sword the country round Was wasted far and wide,
And many a childing mother then And new-born baby died:
But things like that, you know, must be At every famous victory.
