THE WIND
Which is the wind that brings the heat?
The South- Wind, Katy; and corn will grow,
And peaches redden for you to eat,
When the South begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the rain?
The East-Wind, Arty; and farmers know The cows come shivering up the lane When the East begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the flowers?
The West- Wind, Bessy; and soft and low
The birdies sing in the summer hours,
When the West begins to blow.


ITHE WIND
By Robert Louis Stevenson
SAWyou toss the kites on high Andblow the birds about the sky ;
And all around I heard you pass,
Like ladies' skirts across the grassOwind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!
I saw the different things you did,
But always you yourself you hid.
I felt you push, I heard you call,
Icould not see yourself at all- Owind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!

WIND-SONG
O you that are so strong and cold,
O blower are you young or old?
Are you a beast of field and tree,
Or just a stronger child than me?
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud a song!
