LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,
O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night !

O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
!
By Phillips Brooks
LITTLE town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
:
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of wondering love.
Omorning stars together Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
: And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
:
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER
Oholy child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell ;
Oh, come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Immanuel!
PICTURE- BOOKS IN WINTER
By Robert Louis Stevenson
UMMER fading, winter comesWindow robins, winter rooks,
Andthe picture story-books.
Water now is turned to stone
Nurse and I can walk upon;
Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by Wait upon the children's eye,
Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
In the picture story-books.
Wemay see how all things are,
Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies' looks,
In the picture story-books.

THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
How am I to sing your praise,
Happy chimney-corner days,
Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
Reading picture story-books ?
THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
T evening when the lamp is lit, AAround the fire my parents sit;
They sit at home and talk and sing,
Anddo not play at anything.
Now, with mylittle gun, Icrawl All in the dark along the wall,
And follow round the forest track
Away behind the sofa back.
There, in the night,where none canspy,
All in myhunter's camp I lie,
Andplay at books that I have read Till it is time to go to bed.
These are the hills, these are the woods,
These are my starry solitudes ;
And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink.
I see the others far away,
As if in firelit camp they lay,
And I, like to an Indian scout,
Around their party prowled about.
