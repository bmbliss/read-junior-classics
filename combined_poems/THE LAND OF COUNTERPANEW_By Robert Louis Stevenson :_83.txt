THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
Ring out false pride in place andblood,
The civic slander and the spite:
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love ofgood.....
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land- Ring in the Christ that is to be.


THE LAND OF COUNTERPANEW
By Robert Louis Stevenson :
HEN I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
Andall my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills ;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up anddown among the sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
