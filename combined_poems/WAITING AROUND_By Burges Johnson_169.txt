WAITING AROUND
So, Willy, let you and me be wipers Of scores out with all men-especially pipers !
And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,
If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!


WAITING AROUND
By Burges Johnson
T was awful long ago That I put those seeds around;
And I guess I ought to know
When I stuck 'em in the ground.
'Cause I noted down the day
In a little diary book- It's gotten losted somewheres, and
I don't know where to look.
But I'm certain anyhow,
They've been planted 'most a week;
And it must be time by now For their little sprouts to peek.
They've been watered every day With a very speshul care,
And once or twice I've dug 'em up, to
See if they was there.
Ifixed the dirt in humps,
Just the way they said I should;
And I crumbled all the lumps
Just as finely as I could.
