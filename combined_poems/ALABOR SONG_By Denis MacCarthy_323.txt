LABOR SONG
What blue blade that the king's son bearsbut this
Blunt thing-!" he snapt and flung it from his
hand,
And lowering crept away and left the field.
Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,
Andweaponless, and saw the broken sword,
Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,
And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout
Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,
Andsaved a great cause that heroic day.


ALABOR SONG
By Denis MacCarthy
H! little they know of true happiness, they whom satiety fills,
Who, flung on the rich breast of luxury, eat of the
rankness that kills.
Ah! little they know of the blessedness toil-purchased slumber enjoys Who, stretched on the hard rack of indolence, taste
of the sleep that destroys ;
Nothing to hope for, or labor for; nothing to sigh
for, or gain;
Nothing to light in its vividness, lightning-like,
bosom and brain;
Nothing to break life's monotony, rippling it o'er with its breath :
Nothing but dulness and lethargy, weariness,
sorrow, and death!
