YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain!
Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!
The birds singing gayly that came at my call :-
Oh, give me sweet peace of mind, dearer than all !
Home, home, sweet, sweet home !
There's no place like home!


YE MARINERS OF ENGLANDY
By Thomas Campbell
E mariners of England,
That guard our native seas ;
Whose flag has braved, athousand years,
The battle and the breeze!
Your glorious standard launch again
To match another foe!
And sweep through the deep,
While the stormy winds do blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.
The spirits of your fathers Shall start from every wave ;
For the deck it was their field of fame,
And Ocean was their grave.
Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,
Your manly hearts shall glow,
As ye sweep through the deep,
While the stormy winds do blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.
