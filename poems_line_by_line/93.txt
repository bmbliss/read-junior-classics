THE NIGHTINGALE AND
GLOW- WORM
By William Cowper
NIGHTINGALE, that all day long Had cheered the village with his song,
Nor yet at eve his note suspended,
Nor yet when eventide was ended,
Began to feel as well he mightThe keen demands of appetite ;
When, looking eagerly around,
He spied, far off, upon the ground,
Asomething shining in the dark,
Andknew the glow-wormby his spark;
So, stooping down from hawthorn top,
He thought to put him in his crop.
The worm, aware of his intent,
Harangued him thus, quite eloquent- "Did you admire my lamp," quoth he,
"As much as Iyour minstrelsy,
You would abhor to do me wrong,
As much as I to spoil your song;
For ' twas the self-same Power divine
Taught you to sing, and me to shine;
THE LARK AND THE ROOK
That you with music, I with light,
Might beautify and cheer the night. "
The songster heard his short oration,
And, warbling out his approbation,
Released him, as my story tells,
And found a supper somewhere else.
