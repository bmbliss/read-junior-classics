A FAREWELL
By Charles Kingsley
Yfairest child, I have no song to give you ;
No lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray;
Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you
For every day.
Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;
Do noble things, not dream them all day long:
Andso make life, death, and that vast forever
One grand, sweet song.
