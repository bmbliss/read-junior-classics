HARK, HARK! THE LARK!
By William Shakespeare
[ARK, hark! the lark at heaven's gates Hsings,
And Phœbus 'gins arise,
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies ;
And winking Mary-buds begin To ope their golden eyes;
With everything that pretty is,
My lady sweet, arise :
Arise, arise.
