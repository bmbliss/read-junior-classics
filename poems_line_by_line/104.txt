THE KITTEN, AND FALLING LEAVES
By William Wordsworth
EE the kitten on the wall,that fall,
Withered leaves-one-two-and threeFrom the lofty elder tree!
Through the calm and frosty air
Of this morning bright and fair,
Eddying round and round they sink Softly, slowly: one might think,
WHAT THE WIND BRINGS
From the motions that are made,
Every little leaf conveyed Sylph or fairy hither tending- To this lower world descending,
Each invisible and mute,
In his wavering parachute.
But the kitten, how she starts !
Crouches, stretches, paws and darts!
First at one, and then its fellow,
Just as light and just as yellow ;
There are many now-now oneNow they stop and there are none.
What intenseness of desire
In her upward eye of fire!
With a tiger-leap, half-way Now she meets the coming prey;
Lets it go as fast, and then
Has it in her power again:
Now she works with three or four,
Like an Indian conjuror;
Quick as he in feats of art,
Far beyond in joy of heart.
