CHRISTMAS
By Alfred Tennyson
ING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light :
The year is dying in the night- Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new- Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
The year is going, let him go ;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress for all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife;
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
The faithless coldness of the times:
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
Ring out false pride in place andblood,
The civic slander and the spite:
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love ofgood.....
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land- Ring in the Christ that is to be.
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
By Robert Louis Stevenson :
HEN I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
Andall my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills ;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up anddown among the sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
BLOCK CITY
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
Andsees before him, dale andplain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.
