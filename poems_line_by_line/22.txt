THE SHUT-EYE TRAIN
By Eugene Field
OME, my little one, with me!
There are wondrous sights to see
As the evening shadows fall ;
In your pretty cap and gown,
Don't detain
The Shut- Eye train-
"Ting-a-ling!" the bell it goeth,
"Toot-toot !" the whistle bloweth,
And we hear the warning call :
"All aboardfor Shut-Eye Town!"
THE SHUT- EYE TRAIN
Over hill and over plain
Soon will speed the Shut-Eye train!
Through the blue where bloom the stars
And the Mother Moon looks down
We'll away
To land of FayOh, the sights that we shall see there !
Come, my little one, with me there-
"Tis a goodly train of carsAll aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
Swifter than a wild bird's flight,
Through the realms of fleecy light
We shall speed and speed away !
Let the Night in envy frown—
What care we
How wroth she be!
To the Balow-land above us,
To the Balow-folk who love us,
Let us hasten while we may—
All aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
Shut-Eye Town is passing fairGolden dreams await us there;
We shall dream those dreams, my dear,
Till the Mother Moon goes downSee unfold
Delights untold!
And in those mysterious places
We shall see beloved faces
And beloved voices hear
In the grace of Shut-Eye Town.
THE SHUT- EYE TRAIN
We'll call the good doctor in, right straight away;
This can't be neglected asingle more day;
I'll wet my new hankchif and tie it around tight,
'Twill keep you from suffering pains in the night.
I hope you've been good, little dolly, to-day,
Not cross to your nursie, nor rude in your play;
Nor dabbled your feet in those puddles of water The way
you did
yesterday, bad little daughter!
Oh, dear! I'm so sleepy-can't hold up my head,
I'll sing one more verse, then I'll creep into bed.
Cuddle down, dolly,
Here on my arm,
Nothing shall frighten you, nothing shall harm,
Cuddle down sweetly, my little pink rose,
Good angels come now and guard thy repose.
