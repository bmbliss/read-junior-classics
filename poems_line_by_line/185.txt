INGRATITUDE
By William Shakespeare
LOW, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou are not so unkind
As man's ingratitude ;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou are not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.
MERCY
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot ;
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember'd not.
