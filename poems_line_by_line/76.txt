HEAVING OF THE LEAD
By Charles Dibdin
OR England when with favoring gale
Our gallant ship up channel steered,
And, scudding under easy sail,
The high blue western land appeared;
To heave the lead the seaman sprung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the deep-nine !"
Andbearing up to gain the port,
Some well-known object kept in view- An abbey- tower, a harbor-fort,
Or beacon to the vessel true;
While oft the lead the seaman flung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the mark-seven ! "
MORNING
And as the much-loved shore we near,
With transport we behold the roof
Where dwelt a friend or partner dear,
Of faith and love a matchless proof.
The lead once more the seaman flung,
And to the watchful pilot sung,
"Quarter less-five !"
Now to her berth the ship draws nigh :
We shorten sail-she feels the tide-
" Stand clear the cable" is the cryThe anchor's gone; we safely ride.. The watch is set, and through the night
Wehear the seamen with delight
Proclaim-"All's well! "
