THE ARROW AND THE SONG
By Henry W. Longfellow
SHOT an arrow into the air
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
Couldnot follow it in its flight.
I breathed a song into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For who has sight so keen and strong That it can follow the flight of song?
THE SEA
Long, long afterward, in an oak
I found the arrow, still unbroke;
Andthe song, frombeginning to end,
Ifoundagain in the heart of afriend.
