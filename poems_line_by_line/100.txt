THE HOUSEKEEPER
By Charles Lamb
HE frugal snail, with forecast of repose,
Carries his house with him where'er he goes ;
Peeps out-and if there comes a shower of rain,
Retreats to his small domicile again.
Touch but a tip of him, a horn-'tis wellHe curls up inhis sanctuary Shell,
He's his own landlord, his own tenant; stay
Long as he will, he dreads no Quarter Day.
Himself he boards and lodges; both invites And feasts himself; sleeps with himself o' nights
GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
He spares the upholsterer trouble to procure
Chattels ; himself is his own furniture,
Andhis sole riches. Wheresoe'er he roamKnock whenyou will he's sure to be at home.
