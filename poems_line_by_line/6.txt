MOTHER HUBBARD AND HER DOG
Anonymous
LD Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard
To get her poor dog a bone;
But when she came there
The cupboard was bare,
And so the poor dog had none.
She went to the baker's
To buy him some bread,
But when she came back
The poor dog was dead.
She went to the joiner's To buy him a coffin,
But when she came back
The poor dog was laughing.
She took a clean dish
To get him some tripe,
But when she came back
He was smoking his pipe.
She went to the fishmonger's To buy him some fish,
Andwhen she came back
He was licking the dish.
MOTHER HUBBARD
She went to the ale-house
To get him some beer,
But when she got back The dog sat in achair.
She went to the tavern
::
For white wine and red,
But when she came back
The dog stood on his head.
She went to the hatter's
To buy him
a hat
But when she came back
He was feeding the cat
She went to the barber's
To buy him

But when she came back
He was dancing
a jig
She went to the fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit,
But when she came back
He was playing the flute.
She went to the tailor's
To buy him
a coat,
But when she came back
He was riding

She went to the cobbler's
To buy him some shoes
But when she came back
He was reading the news
