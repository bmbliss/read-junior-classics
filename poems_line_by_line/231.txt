THE BOWMAN'S SONG
By Arthur Conan Doyle
WHATof the bow? The bow was made in England:
Of true wood, of yew wood,
The wood of English bows ;
So men who are free
Love the old yew-tree
And the land where the yew-tree grows.
What of the cord?
The cord was made in England:
Arough cord, a tough cord,
Acord that bowmen love;
So we'll drain our jacks To the English flax And the land where the hemp was wove.
OLD IRONSIDES
What of the shaft?
The shaft was cut in England:
Along shaft, a strong shaft,
Barbed and trim and true ;
So we'll drink all together
To the gray goose feather,
And the land where the gray goose flew.
What of the men?
The men were bred in England:
The bowman-the yeomanThe lads of dale and fell.
Here's to you and to you!
To the hearts that are true
And the land where the true hearts dwell.
