OPPORTUNITY
By Edward Rowland Sill
HIS I beheld, or dreamed it in adream:-
There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;
Andunderneath the cloud, or in it, raged
Afurious battle, and men yelled, and swords
Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner
Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by
foes.
Acraven hung along the battle's edge,
And thought, "Had I a sword of keener steel260
LABOR SONG
What blue blade that the king's son bearsbut this
Blunt thing-!" he snapt and flung it from his
hand,
And lowering crept away and left the field.
Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,
Andweaponless, and saw the broken sword,
Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,
And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout
Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,
Andsaved a great cause that heroic day.
