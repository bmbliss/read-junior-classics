SUCCESSION OF THE FOUR
SWEET MONTHS
By Robert Herrick
IRST, April, she with mellow showers,
Opens the way for early flowers ;
Then after her comes smiling May,
In amore rich and sweet array;
Next enters June, and brings us more
Gems, than those two that went before;
Then, lastly, July comes, and she
More wealth brings in than all those three.
