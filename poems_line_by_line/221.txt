CONCORD HYMN
By R. W. Emerson
Ythe rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
Andfired the shot heard round the world.
О САРТAIN! MY CAPTAIN
The foe long since in silence slept ;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps ;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set to-day a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.
