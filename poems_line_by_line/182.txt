REPUTATION
By William Shakespeare
MOOD name in man or woman, dear my lord,
☑ Is the immediate jewel of their souls :
Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something,
nothing;
'Twasmine, 'tishis, and has been slave to thousands ;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
-From " Othello."
