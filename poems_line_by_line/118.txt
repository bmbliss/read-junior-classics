THE MILKMAID
By Jeffreys Taylor
MILKMAID, who poised a full pail on her
head,
Thus mused onher prospects in life, it is said :
" Let me see-I should think that this milk will
procure Onehundred good eggs, or fourscore, to be sure.
"Well then-stop a bit-it must not be forgotten,
Some of these may be broken, and some may be
rotten ;
THE MILKMAID
But if twenty for accident should be detached,
It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to be hatched.
"Well, sixty sound eggs-no, sound chickens, I
mean:
Of these some may die-we'll suppose seventeen,
Seventeen! not so many-say ten at the most,
Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast.
"But then there's their barley: how much will they
need?
Why, they take but one grain at atime when they feedSo that's a mere trifle ; now then, let us see,
At a fair market price how much money there'll be.
" Six shillings a pair-five-four-three-and-six,
To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix ;
Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said- Fifty times three-and-sixpence-I'll ask Brother Ned.
"O, but
'em;
stop-three-and-sixpence apair I must sell
Well, a pair is a couple-now then let us tell 'em;
Acouple in fifty will go (mypoorbrain!)
Why, just a score times, and five pair will remain.
"Twenty- five pairs of fowls-now how tiresome
it is
That I can't reckon up so much money as this !
Well, there's no use in trying, so let's give a guess- I'll say twenty pounds, and it can't be no less.

HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD
"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,
Thirty geese, and two turkeys-eight pigs and a
Sow;
Nowif these turn out well, at the end of the year,
I shall fill both my pockets with guineas, 'tis clear."
Forgetting her burden, when this she had said,
The maid superciliously tossed up her head;
When, alas for her prospects! her milk-pail de- scended,
And so all her schemes for the future were ended.
This moral, I think, may be safely attached- "Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatched."
