ROBERT OF LINCOLN
By William Cullen Bryant
ERRILY swinging on brier and weed,
Near to the nest of his little dame,
Over the mountain-side or mead,
Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Snug and safe is this nest of ours,
Hidden among the summer flowers.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln is gayly dressed,
Wearing a bright, black wedding-coat ;
White are his shoulders, and white his crest,
Hear him call in his merry note,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Look what a nice, new coat is mine;
Sure there was never abird so fine.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,
Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,
Passing at home a patient life,
Broods in the grass while her husband sings Bob-o'-link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Brood, kind creature, you need not fear Thieves and robbers while I am here.
Chee, chee, chee.
ROBERT OF LINCOLN
Modest and shy as a nun is she ;
One weak chirp is her only note ;
Braggart, and prince of braggarts is he,
Pouring boasts from his little throat,
Bob-o' - link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Never was I afraid of man,
Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.
Chee, chee, chee.
Six white eggs on abed of hay,
Flecked with purple, apretty sight :
There as the mother sits all day,
Robert is singing with all his might,
Bob-o'-link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Nice good wife that never goes out,
Keeping house while I frolic about.
Chee, chee, chee.
Soon as the little ones chip the shell,
Six wide mouths are open for food ;
Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,
Gathering seeds for the hungry brood.
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
This new life is likely to be
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln at length is made
Sober with work, and silent with care,
TO THE LADY-BIRD
Off is his holiday garment laid,
Half forgotten that merry air,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Nobody knows but my mate and I,
Where our nest and our nestlings lie.
Chee, chee, chee.
Summer wanes; the children are grown;
Fun and frolic no more he knows,
Robert of Lincoln's a hum-drum drone;
Off he flies, and we sing as he goes,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' - link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Whenyou can pipe that merry old strain,
Robert of Lincoln, come back again.
Chee, chee, chee.
