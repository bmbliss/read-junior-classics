WINDY NIGHTS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
HENEVERthe moon and starsareset,
Whenever the wind is high,
All night long in the dark and wet,
Amangoes riding by.
Late in the night when the fires are out,
Whydoes he gallop and gallop about?
THE WIND AND THE MOON
Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
And ships are tossed at sea,
By, on the highway, low and loud,
By at the gallop goes he.
By at the gallop he goes, and then
By he comes back at the gallop again.
