THE FAIRY FOLK
By William Allingham
UPP the airy mountain,
Down the rushy glen,
We daren't go a-hunting,
For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together ;
Green jacket, red cap,
Andwhite owl's feather.
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home,
They live on crispy pancakes
Of yellow tide-foam;
Some in the reeds
Of the black mountain-lake,
With frogs for their watch-dogs,
All night awake.
High on the hill-top The old King sits ;
He is now so old and gray He's nigh lost his wits.
THE FAIRY FOLK
With
a bridge of white mist Columbkill he crosses,
Onhis stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses
Or going up with music
On cold starry nights
To sup with the Queen
Of the gay Northern Lights
They stole little Bridget For seven years long;
When she came down again
Her friends were all gone.
They took her lightly back Between the night and morrow
They thought that she was fast asleep
But she was dead with sorrow
They have kept her ever since
Deep within the lakes
On
abed of flag leaves
Watching till she wakes.
By the craggy hill-side,
Through the mosses bare
They have planted thorn trees
For pleasure here and there
Isanymanso daring
As dig one up in spite
He shall find the thornies set
Inhis bed at night.
Upthe airy mountain,
Down the rushyglen,
THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
We daren't go a-hunting For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together;
Green jacket, red cap,
And white owl's feather.
