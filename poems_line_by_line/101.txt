SONG
By Alfred Tennyson
CHE winds, as at their hour of birth,
Leaning upon the ridged sea,
Breathed low around the rolling earth
With the mellow preludes, "We are free,"
The streams through many a lilied row
Down-carolling to the crisped sea,
Low-tinkled with abell-like flow
Atween the blossoms, "We are free."
