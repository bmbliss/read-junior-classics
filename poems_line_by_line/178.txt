WOLSEY'S FALL
By William Shakespeare
MAREWELL, along farewell, to all mygreat- Fness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost ;
And-whenhe thinks, good easy man, full surely His greatness is a ripening-nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
SEVEN AGES OF MAN
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye :
I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors !
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have :
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.
-From "Henry VIII."
