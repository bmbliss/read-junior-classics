RULE BRITANNIA!
By James Thomson
HEN Britain first, at Heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main,
This was the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sing the strain:
Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!
Britons never will be slaves.
The nations not so blest as thee,
Must, in their turn, to tyrants fall;
Whilst thou shalt flourish, great and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
Rule Britannia! etc.
Still more majestic shalt thou rise,
More dreadful from each foreign stroke,
As the loud blasts that tear thy skies
Serve but to root thy native oak.
Rule Britannia! etc.
THE WATCH ON THE RHINE
Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;
All their attempts to hurl thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame,
And work their woe-but thy renown.
Rule Britannia! etc.
To thee belongs the rural reign;
Thy cities shall with commerce shine;
All thine shall be the subject main,
And every shore encircle thine.
Rule Britannia! etc.
The Muses, still with Freedom found,
Shall to thy happy coast repair;
Blest Isle! with matchless beauty crowned,
And manly hearts to guard the fair.
Rule Britannia! etc.
