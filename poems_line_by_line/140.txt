THE BROOK
By Alfred Tennyson
COME from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally,
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.
THE BROOK
By thirty hills
I hurry down
Or slip between the ridges
By twenty thorps,
a little town,
And half
a hundred bridges
Till last by Philip's farm
I flow To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
I chatter over stony ways
In little sharps and trebles,
I bubble into eddying bays
I babble on the pebbles
With many
a curve my banks
I fret
By many
a field and fallow,
Andmany
a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow
I chatter, chatter
, as
I flow
To join the brimming river
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
Iwind about
, and in and out,
With here
a blossom sailing
Andhere and there
a lusty trout,
Andhere and there
agrayling
And here and there
a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak
Above the golden gravel,
THE BUGLE SONG
And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
I slide by hazel covers ;
I move the sweet forget-me-nots
That grow for happy lovers.
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
Among my skimming swallows ;
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy shallows.
I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesses ;
Ilinger by my shingly bars ;
I loiter round my cresses ;
'And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
