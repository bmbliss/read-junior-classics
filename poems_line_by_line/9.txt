A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
By Richard Le Gallienne
So far and fast to-day;
ran
The birds are weary, for who sang
So many songs as they?
The bees and butterflies at last
Are tired out, for just think, too,
Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through,
And so, as all tired people do,
They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds.
The sun has shut his golden eye
And gone to sleep beneath the sky,
The birds and butterflies and bees
Have all crept into flowers and trees,
And all lie quiet, still as mice,
Till morning comes-like father's voice.
So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you
SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!
Must sleep away till morning, too.
Close little eyes, down little heads,
And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.
