THE DANCERS
By Michael Field
DANCE and dance! Another faun,
Ablackone, dances onthe lawn.
He moves with me, and when I lift
My heels his feet directly shift :
Ican't outdance him though I try;
He dances nimbler than I.
I toss myhead and so does he;
What tricks he dares to play onme!
I touch the ivy in my hair ;
Ivy he has and finger there.
The spiteful thing to mock meso!
Iwill outdance him! Ho, ho, ho!
