TO-DAY
By Thomas Carlyle
O here hath beendawning Another blue Day:
Think wilt thou let it
Slip useless away.
MY SHADOW
Out of Eternity
This new Day is born;
Into Eternity,
At night, will return.
Behold it aforetime
No eye ever did :
So soon it forever
From all eyes is hid.
Here hath been dawning
Another blue Day;
Think wilt thou let it
Slip useless away.
