THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
By Edward Fitzgerald
'T
IS adull sight To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing :
Sighing, oh ! sighing :
When such a time cometh,
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire :
Oh, pile a bright fire!
THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings- Oh, drearily sings !
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast :
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry- Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth- How ' twas gladsome, but often Foolish, forsooth :
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or to get merry We sing some old rhyme,
That made the wood ring again In summer timeSweet summer time!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrilySo merrily !
HIAWATHA'S SAILING
And ere to bed
Gowe, go we,
Down on the ashes
Wekneel on the knee,
Praying together !
Thus, then, live I,
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By heaven! the bold sun Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green,
Ijump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!
