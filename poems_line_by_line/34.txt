A BABY'S FEET
By Algernon Charles Swinburne
BABY'S feet, like sea shells pink,
Might tempt, should heaven see meet,
An angel's lips to kiss, we thinkAbaby's feet.
Like rose-hued sea flowers toward the heat
They stretch and spread and wink Their ten soft buds that part and meet.
THE FAIRY FOLK
No flower bells that expand and shrink Gleamhalf so heavenly sweet,
As shine on life's untrodden brinkAbaby's feet.
