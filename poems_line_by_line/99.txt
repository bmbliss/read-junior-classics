THE ANT AND THE CRICKET
Anonymous
ASILLY Throughyoung the cricket warm,, accustomed sunny months to singgay
summer and spring,
Began to complain, whenhe found that at home
His cupboard was empty and winter was come.
Not a crumb to be found
On the snow-covered ground;
Not a flower could he see,
Not a leaf on a tree :
"Oh, what will become," says the cricket, "of me? "
At last, by starvation and famine made bold,
All dripping with wet and all trembling with cold,
Awayhe set off to a miserly ant,
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant Him shelter from rain;
Amouthful of grain
He wished only to borrow,
He'd repay it to-morrow ;
If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.
THE HOUSEKEEPER
Says the ant to the cricket, "I'm your servant and
friend,
But we ants never borrow, we ants never lend;
But tell me, dear sir, did you lay nothing by When the weather was warm?" Said the cricket,
Not I.
My heart is so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay"-
"You sang, sir, you say?
Gothen," said the ant, "and dance winter away."
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Though this is afable, the moral is good:
If you live without work, you must live without food.
