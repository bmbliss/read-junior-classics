THE OLD FLAG
By H. C. Bunner
FF with your hat as the flag goes by!
And let the heart have its say;
You're man enough for a tear in your eye That you will not wipe away.
You're manenough for a thrill that goes
To your very finger-tipsAy! the lump just then in your throat that rose Spoke more than your parted lips.
Lift up the boy on your shoulder high,
And show him the faded shredThose stripes would be red as the sunset sky If Death could have dyed them red.
The man that bore it with Death has lain
This twenty years and moreHe died that the work should not be in vain
Of the men who bore it before.
BARBARA FRIETCHIE
The man that bears it is bent and old,
And ragged his beard and grayBut look at his eye fire young and bold,
At the tune that he hears them play.
The old tune thunders through all the air,
And strikes right in to the heart ;
If ever it calls for you, boy, be there!
Be there, and ready to start.
Off with your hat as the flag goes by!
Uncover the youngster's head!
Teach him to hold it holy and high For the sake of its sacred dead.
