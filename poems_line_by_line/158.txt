DAISIES
By John Dryden
TUFT of daisies on a flowery lea ATUFTOF
way;
and thitherward they bent their
To this both knights and dames their homage made,
Anddue obeisance to the daisy paid.
And then the band of flutes began to play,
To which a lady sang avirelay:
And still at every close she would repeat The burthen of the song: "The daisy is so sweet."
