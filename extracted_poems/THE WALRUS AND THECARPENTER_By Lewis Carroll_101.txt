THE WALRUS AND THECARPENTER
By Lewis Carroll
THE sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all its might :
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright- Andthis was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Hadgot no business to be there After the day was done-
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"
