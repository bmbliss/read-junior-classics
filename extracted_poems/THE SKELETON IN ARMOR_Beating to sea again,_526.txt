THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
Beating to sea again,
Through the wild hurricane,
Bore I the maiden.
"Three weeks we westward bore,
And when the storm was o'er,
Cloud- like we saw the shore
Stretching to leeward;
There for my lady's bower Built I the lofty tower
Which to this very hour Stands looking seaward.
"There lived we many years;
Time dried the maiden's tears;
She had forgot her fears,
She was a mother ;
Death closed her mild blue eyes;
Under that tower she lies ;
Ne'er shall the sun arise
On such another.
"Still grew my bosom then,
Still as a stagnant fen!
Hateful to me were men,
The sunlight hateful!
In the vast forest here,
Clad in my warlike gear,
Fell I upon my spear,
Oh, death was grateful!
"Thus, seamed with many scars,
Bursting these prison bars,
