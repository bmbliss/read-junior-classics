SMALL BEGINNINGS
By Charles Mackay
TRAVELLER through a dusty road strewed
acorns on the lea ;
And one took root and sprouted up, and grew
into a tree.
Love sought its shade, at evening time, to breathe its early vows ;
And age was pleased, in heats of noon, to bask beneath its boughs ;
The dormouse loved its dangling twigs, the birds sweet music bore;
It stood a glory in its place, a blessing evermore.
