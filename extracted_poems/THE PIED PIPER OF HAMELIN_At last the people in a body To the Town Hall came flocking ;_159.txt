THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
At last the people in a body To the Town Hall came flocking ;
" Tis clear," cried they, " our Mayor's a noddy ;
And as for our Corporation-shocking To think we buy gowns lined with ermine For dolts that can't or won't determine
What's best to rid us of our vermin !
You hope, because you're old and obese,
To find in the furry civic robe ease ?
Rouse up, sirs ! Give your brains a racking To find the remedy we're lacking,
Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing ! "
At this the Mayor and Corporation Quaked with a mighty consternation.
Anhour they sat in council ;
At length the Mayor broke silence ;
"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell ;
I wish I were a mile hence !
It's easy to bid one rack one's brainI'm sure my poor head aches again,
I've scratched it so, and all in vain.
Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap ! "
Just as he said this, what should hap At the chamber door, but a gentle tap ?
" Bless us ! " cried the Mayor, "what's that?"
(With the Corporation as he sat,
Looking little though wondrous fat ;
Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister
Than a too-long-opened oyster,
Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous For a plate of turtle green and glutinous.)
" Only a scraping of shoes on the mat ?
