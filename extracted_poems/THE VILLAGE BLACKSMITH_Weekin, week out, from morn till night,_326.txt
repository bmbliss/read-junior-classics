THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH
Weekin, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is low.
Andchildren coming home from school Look in at the open door ;
They love to see the flaming forge,
And hear the bellows roar,
Andcatch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing floor.
He goes on Sunday to the church,
And sits among his boys ;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
Hehears his daughter's voice,
Singing in the village choir,
And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother's voice,
Singing in Paradise !
He needs must think of her once more,
How in the grave she lies ;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes Atear out of his eyes.
Toiling-rejoicing-sorrowing,
Onward through life he goes ;
Each morning sees some task begin,
Each evening sees it close ;
Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night's repose.
