THE GOOD NEWS
By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay
spur!
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,
We'll remember at Aix "-for one heard the quick
wheeze
Ofher chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering
knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky ;
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff ;
Till over by Dalhem adome-spire sprang white,
And " Gallop," gasped Joris, "forAix is in sight ! "
"How they'll greet us! "-and all in amoment his
roan
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone ;
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her
fate,
With nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called myRoland his pet-name, myhorse without
peer ;

THE BOWMAN'S SONG
:
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise,
bad or good,
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
And all I remember is-friends flocking round
As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the
ground;
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of
wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news
from Ghent.
THE BOWMAN'S SONG
By Arthur Conan Doyle
WHATof the bow? The bow was made in England:
Of true wood, of yew wood,
The wood of English bows ;
So men who are free
Love the old yew-tree
And the land where the yew-tree grows.
What of the cord?
The cord was made in England:
Arough cord, a tough cord,
Acord that bowmen love;
So we'll drain our jacks To the English flax And the land where the hemp was wove.
