THE ANCIENT MARINER
An orphan's curse would drag to hell Aspirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is the curse in adead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.
The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide :
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two besideHer beams bemocked the sultry main,
Like April hoar-frost spread;
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
Astill and awful red.
Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes :
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes.
Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire :
Blue glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire.
Ohappy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare :
Aspring of love gushed from myheart,
And I blessed them unaware:
