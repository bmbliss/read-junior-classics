DANISH NATIONAL HYMN
Liberty calls us from mountain and valley;
Waving her banner she leads to the fight.
Forward! all forward! the trumpets are crying ;
The drum beats to arms, our old flag is flying ;
Stout hearts and strong hands around it shall rally,
Forward to battle, for God and the Right.
Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free.
