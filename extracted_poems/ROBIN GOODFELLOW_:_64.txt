ROBIN GOODFELLOW
:
Or else, unseen, with them I go,
All in the nick
To play some trick,
And frolic it, with ho, ho, ho!
Sometimes I meet them like a man,
Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound;
And to a horse I turn me can,
To trip and trot about them round.
But if to ride,
My back they stride,
More swift than wind away I go,
O'er hedge and lands,
Through pools and ponds,
I hurry, laughing, ho, ho, ho !
By wells and rills, in meadows green,
We nightly dance our heyday guise;
Andto our fairy King and Queen,
We chant our moonlight minstrelsies.
When larks 'gin sing,
Away we fling ;
And babes new born steal as we go;
And elf in bed,
We leave instead,
And wend us laughing, ho, ho, ho!
From hag-bred Merlin's time have I
Thus nightly revell'd to and fro ;
And for my pranks men call meby The name of Robin Goodfellow.
Fiends, ghosts, and sprites,
Who haunt the nights,
