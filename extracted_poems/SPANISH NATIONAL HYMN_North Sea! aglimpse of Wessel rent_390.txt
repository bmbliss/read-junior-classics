SPANISH NATIONAL HYMN
North Sea! aglimpse of Wessel rent
Thy murky sky !
Then champions to thine arms were sent;
Terror and Death glared where he went;
From the waves was heard a wail, that rent
Thy murky sky !
From Denmark thunders Tordenskiol!
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul,
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul andfly.
Path of the Dane to fame and might!
Dark rolling wave!
Receive thy friend, who scorning flight,
Goes to meet danger with despite,
Proudly as thou the tempest's might,
Dark rolling wave!
'Mid mingled pleasures and alarms,
Andwar and vict'ry be thine arms,
'Midwar and vict'ry, be thine arms mygrave.
