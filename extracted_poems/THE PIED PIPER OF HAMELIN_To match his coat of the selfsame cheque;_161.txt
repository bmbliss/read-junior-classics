THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
To match his coat of the selfsame cheque;
And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying As if impatient to be playing
Uponhis pipe, as low it dangled Over his vesture so old-fangled. )
"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am,
In Tartary I freed the Cham,
Last June, from his huge swarm of gnats;
I eased in Asia the Nizam
Of amonstrous brood of vampyre bats:
And as for what your brain bewilders,
If I can rid your town of rats Will you give me a thousand guilders?"
"One? fifty thousand! "-was the exclamation
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
Into the street the Piper stept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept In his quiet pipe the while;
Then, like a musical adept,
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,
Andgreenandblue his sharp eyes twinkled,
Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
Andere three shrill notes the pipehad uttered,
You heard as if an army muttered ;
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumb- ling;
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,
