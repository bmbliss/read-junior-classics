THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
For well he knew the silly fly
Would soon be back again;
So he wove a subtle thread
In a little corner sly,
And set his table ready
To dine upon the fly.
Hewent out to his door again,
Andmerrily did sing,
"Come hither, hither, pretty fly,
With the pearl and silver wing;
Your robes are green and purple,
There's a crest upon your head;
Your eyes are like the diamond bright,
But mine are dull as lead."
Alas, alas ! how very soon This silly little fly,
Hearing his wily, flattering words,
Came slowly flitting by:
With buzzing wings she hung aloft,
Then near and nearer drewThought only of her brilliant eyes,
Andgreen and purple hue;
Thought only of her crested head- Poor foolish thing ! At last Upjumped the cunning spider,
And fiercely held her fast.
Hedragged her up his winding stair,
Into his dismal den
Within his little parlor-but
She ne'er came out again!

THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE
And now, dear little children
Whomay this story read,
To idle, silly, flattering words,
I pray you, ne'er give heed:
Unto an evil counsellor
Close heart and ear and eye,
And learn alesson from this tale
Of the spider and the fly.
