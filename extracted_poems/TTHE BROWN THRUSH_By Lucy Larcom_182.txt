TTHE BROWN THRUSH
By Lucy Larcom
HERE'S amerry brown thrush sitting up in
the tree-
"He's singing to me! He's singing to me!"
Andwhat does he say, little girl, little boy?
"Oh, the world's running over with joy!
Don't you hear? don't you see?
Hush! Look! In my tree,
I'm as happy as happy can be!"
And the brown thrush keeps singing, "Anest do
you see,
And five eggs hid by mein the juniper-tree?
Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,
Or the world will lose some of its joy!
Now I'm glad! now I'm free!
And I always shall be,
If you never bring sorrow to me."
