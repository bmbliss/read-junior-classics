THE GOOD NEWS
Not a word to each other ; we kept the great pace Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place ;
I turned in my saddle and made its girth tight,
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
'Twas moonset at starting ; but while we drew near Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear ;
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see ;
At DÃ¼ffeld, ' twas morning as plain as could be ;
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the
half-chime,
So Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time ! "
At Aershot, up leaped of asudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one To stare through the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
With resolute shoulders, each butting away The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray ;
Andhis low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his
track ;
And one eye's black intelligence ever that glance O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance !
And the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and
anon
His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on.
