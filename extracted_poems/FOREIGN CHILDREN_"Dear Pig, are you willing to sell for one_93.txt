FOREIGN CHILDREN
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one
shilling
Your ring?" Said the piggy, " I will."
So they took it away, and were married next
day
By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined upon mince and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon,
Andhand in hand on the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon.
They danced by the light of the moon.
