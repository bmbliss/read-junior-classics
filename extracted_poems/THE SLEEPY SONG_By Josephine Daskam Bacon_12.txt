THE SLEEPY SONG
By Josephine Daskam Bacon
S soon as the fire burns red and low
Andthe house upstairs is still,
She sings me a queer little sleepy song,
Of sheep that go over the hill.
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
Their colors are gray and white;
They follow their leader nose and tail,
For they must be home by night.
Andone slips over, and one comes next,
Andone runs after behind;
The gray one's nose at the white one's tail,
The top of the hill they find.
