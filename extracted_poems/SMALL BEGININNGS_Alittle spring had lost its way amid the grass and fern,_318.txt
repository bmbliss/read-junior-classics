SMALL BEGININNGS
Alittle spring had lost its way amid the grass and fern,
Apassing stranger scooped a well, where weary men might turn;
He walled it in, and hung with care a ladle at the
brink;
He thought not of the deed he did, but judged that toil might drink.
He passed again, and lo! the well, by summers never dried,
Had cooled ten thousand parching tongues, and saved a life beside.
Adreamer dropped a random thought; 'twas old,
and yet 'twas new;
√Åsimple fancy of the brain, but strong in being
true.
It shone upon a genial mind, and lo! its light became
Alamp of life, abeacon ray, amonitory flame.
The thought was small; its issue great; a watch-fire on the hill ;
It sheds its radiance far adown, and cheers the
valley still!
Anameless man, amid acrowd that thronged the daily mart,
Let fall a word of Hope and Love, unstudied from the heart;
A whisper on the tumult thrown-a transitory
breathIt raised a brother from the dust; it saved a soul
from death.
