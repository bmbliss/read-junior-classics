THE BELLS
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells !
Hear the loud alarum bellsBrazen bells !
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright !
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
Inthe clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In amad expostulation with the deaf and frantic
fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now-now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells !
What a tale their terror tells
Of despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air !
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,
