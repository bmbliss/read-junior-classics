SPARE THAT TREE
And blue-black beetles transact business,
And gnats fly in ahost And furry caterpillars hasten
That no time be lost,
Andmoths grow fat and thrive,
And lady birds arrive.
Before green apples blush,
Before green nuts embrown,
Why, one day in the country
Is worth a month in townIs worth a day and ayear
Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion That days drone elsewhere.
WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE !
By George Pope Morris
WOODMAN,aspare singlethat boughtree!
In youth it sheltered me,
And I'll protect it now.
'Twas my forefather's hand That placed it near his cot;
There, woodman, let it stand,
Thy ax shall harm it not.
That old familiar tree,
Whose glory and renown
Are spread o'er land and sea- And wouldst thou hew it down?
:

DAISY'S SONG
Woodman, forbear thy stroke !
Cut not its earth-bound ties ;
Oh, spare that aged oak Now towering to the skies !
Whenbut an idle boy,
I sought its grateful shade ;
In all their gushing joy Here, too, my sisters played.
My mother kissed me here ;
My father pressed my hand- Forgive this foolish tear,
But let that old oak stand.
My heart-strings round thee cling,
Close as thy bark, old friend !
Here shall the wild-bird sing,
And still thy branches bend.
Old tree! the storm still brave !
And, woodman, leave the spot ;
While I've a hand to save,
Thy ax shall harm it not.
