HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms Clashed in the bloody dust.
Then Ocnus of Falerii
Rushed on the Roman three ;
And Lausulus of Urgo,
The rover of the sea;
And Aruns of Volsinium,
Who slew the great wild boar- The great wild boar that had his den
Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,
And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,
Along Albinia's shore.
Herminius smote down Aruns ;
Lartius laid Ocnus low;
Right to the heart of Lausulus
Horatius sent a blow:
" Lie there, " he cried, "fell pirate !
No more, aghast and pale,
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
The track of thy destroying bark;
No more Campania's hinds shall fly
To woods and caverns, when they spy
Thy thrice-accurs√©d sail ! "
But now no sound of laughter Was heard among the foes ;
Awild and wrathful clamor
From all the vanguard rose
Six spears' lengths from the entrance,
Halted that deep array,
