THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"We bring our great King Robert's heart
Across the weltering wave,
To lay it in the holy soil Hard by the Saviour's grave.
"True pilgrims we, by land or sea,
Where danger bars the way;
And therefore are we here, Lord King,
To ride with thee this day! "
The King has bent his stately head,
And the tears were in his eyne-
"God's blessing on thee, noble knight,
For this brave thought of thine !
"I know thy name full well, Lord James;
And honored may I be,
That those who fought beside the Bruce
Should fight this day for me!
"Take thou the leading of the van,
And charge the Moors amain;
There is not such a lance as thine
In all the host of Spain! "
The Douglas turned towards us then,
O, but his glance was high !
"There is not one of all mymen
But is as bold as I.
"There is not one of all my knights
But bears as true a spearThen onward, Scottish gentlemen,
And think King Robert's here!"
