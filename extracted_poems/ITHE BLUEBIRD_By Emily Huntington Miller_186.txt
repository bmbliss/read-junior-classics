ITHE BLUEBIRD
By Emily Huntington Miller
KNOW the song that the bluebird is singing,
Out in the apple-tree where he is swinging,
Brave little fellow ! the skies may be drearyNothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.
Hark! how the music leaps out from his throat !
Hark! was there ever so merry a note?
Listen awhile, and you'll hear what he's saying,
Up in the apple-tree swinging and swaying :
"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,
You must be weary of winter, I know;
Hark while I sing you a message of cheer:
Summer is coming! and spring-time is here!
