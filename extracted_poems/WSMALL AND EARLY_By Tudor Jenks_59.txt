WSMALL AND EARLY
By Tudor Jenks
!
HEN Dorothy and I took tea, we sat upon
the floor;
No matter how much tea I drank, she always gave
me more;
Our table was the scarlet box in which her teaset came;
Our guests, an armless one-eyed doll, a wooden
horse gone lame.
She poured out nothing, very fast-the tea pot tipped on high- And in the bowl found sugar lumps unseen by my
dull eye.

She added rich ( pretended) cream-it seemed a
wilful waste,
For though she overflowed the cup, it did not change the taste.
She asked, " Take milk?" or "Sugar?" and though I answered "No, "
She put them in, and told me that I "must take it so!"
She'd say "Another cup, Papa?" and I, "No, thank you, Ma'am, "
But then I had to take it-her courtesy was sham.
