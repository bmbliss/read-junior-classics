THE WATCH ON THE RHINE
Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;
All their attempts to hurl thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame,
And work their woe-but thy renown.
Rule Britannia! etc.
To thee belongs the rural reign;
Thy cities shall with commerce shine;
All thine shall be the subject main,
And every shore encircle thine.
Rule Britannia! etc.
The Muses, still with Freedom found,
Shall to thy happy coast repair;
Blest Isle! with matchless beauty crowned,
And manly hearts to guard the fair.
Rule Britannia! etc.
