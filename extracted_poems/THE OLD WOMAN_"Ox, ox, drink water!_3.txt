THE OLD WOMAN
"Ox, ox, drink water!
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick ;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig ;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the ox would not.
She went a little further, and she met a butcher.
So she said-
"Butcher, butcher, kill ox!
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the butcher would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rope.
So she saidJun. Cl-10
"Rope, rope, hang butcher!
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick ;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig ;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night. "
