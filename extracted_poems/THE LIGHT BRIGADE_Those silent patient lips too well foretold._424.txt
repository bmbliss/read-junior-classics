THE LIGHT BRIGADE
Those silent patient lips too well foretold.
Yes, this is he who ruled a world of men
As might some prophet of the elder dayBrooding above the tempest and the fray With deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken.
Apower was his beyond the touch of art Or armÃ«d strength-his pure and mighty heart.
