The man that bears it is bent and old,
And ragged his beard and grayBut look at his eye fire young and bold,
At the tune that he hears them play.
The old tune thunders through all the air,
And strikes right in to the heart ;
If ever it calls for you, boy, be there!
Be there, and ready to start.
Off with your hat as the flag goes by!
Uncover the youngster's head!
Teach him to hold it holy and high For the sake of its sacred dead.
