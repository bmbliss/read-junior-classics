TO A SKYLARK
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was,
Joyous and clear and fresh-thy music doth
surpass.
Teach us, sprite or bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine :
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus hymeneal
Or triumphal chaunt,
Match'd with thine, would be all
But an empty vauntA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden
want.
What objects are the fountains Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of
pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
