THE RHODORA
Who envies none that chance doth raise,
Nor vice ; who never understood
Howdeepest wounds are given by praise ;
Nor rules of state, but rules of good;
Who hath his life from rumors freed;
Whoseconscience is his strong retreat ;
Whose state can neither flatterers feed,
Nor ruin make oppressors great ;
Who God doth late and early pray
More of his grace than gifts to lend ;
And entertains the harmless day
With a religious book or friend.
This man is freed from servile bands
Of hope to rise or fear to fall :
Lord of himself, though not of lands,
And, having nothing, yet hath all.
