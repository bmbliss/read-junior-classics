LOCHINVAR
So boldly he entered the Netherby hall,
'Mong bridesmen and kinsmen, and brothers and
all.
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword (For the poor craven bridegroom said never a
word) ,
"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"
"I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied.
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;
Andnow I am come, with this lost love of mine To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far That would gladly be bride to the young Lochin- var."
The bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up :
He quaffed off the wine, and he threwdownthecup.
She looked down to blush, and shelooked up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
He took her soft hand ere her mother could bar-
"Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.
So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
That never ahall such agalliard did grace;
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bride-maidens whispered, " Twere better by far To have natched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
