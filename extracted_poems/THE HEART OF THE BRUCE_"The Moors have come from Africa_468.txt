THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"The Moors have come from Africa
To spoil and waste and slay,
AndKing Alonzo of Castile
Must fight with them to-day."
"Now shame it were," cried good LordJames,
"Shall never be said of me
That I and mine have turned aside
From the Cross in jeopardie!
"Have down, have down, my merry men all- Have down unto the plain;
We'll let the Scottish lion loose
Within the fields of Spain! "
"Now welcome to me, noble lord,
Thou and thy stalwart power;
Dear is the sight of a Christian knight,
Who comes in such an hour!
"Is it for bond or faith you come,
Or yet for golden fee?
Or bring ye France's lilies here,
Or the flower of Burgundie?"
"God greet thee well, thou valiant king,
Thee and thy belted peersSir James of Douglas am I called,
And these are Scottish spears.
"We do not fight for bond or plight,
Nor yet for golden fee ;
But for the sake of our blessed Lord,
Who died upon the tree.
