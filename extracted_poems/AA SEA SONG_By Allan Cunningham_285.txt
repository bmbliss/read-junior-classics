AA SEA SONG
By Allan Cunningham
WET sheet and a flowing sea,
Awind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail Andbends the gallant mast ;
And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While, like the eagle free,
Away the good ship flies, and leaves
Old England on the lee.
"Ofor a soft and gentle wind! "
I heard a fair one cry ;
But give to me the snoring breeze And white waves heaving high ;
And white waves heaving high, my lads,
The good ship tight and free- The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.
