ITHE VOICE OF SPRING
By Mary Howitt
AM coming, I am coming!
Hark! the little bee is humming;
See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky;
And the gnats are on the wing,
Wheeling round in airy ring.
See the yellow catkins cover
All the slender willows over !
And on the banks of mossy green Star-like primroses are seen;
And, their clustering leaves below,
White and purple violets blow.
Hark! the new-born lambs are bleating,
Andthe cawing rooks are meeting In the elms a noisy crowd;
All the birds are singing loud ;
And the first white butterfly Inthe sunshine dances by.
