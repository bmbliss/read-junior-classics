By Julia Ward Howe
INE eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
Hehath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps ;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps ;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps ;
His day is marching on.
I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows
of steel:
"As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal :
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,
Since God is marching on."
