THE FLAG GOES BY
Hehas sounded forth the trumpet that shall never
call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His
judgment-seat :
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him-be jubilant,
my feet!
Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across
the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you
and me:
As He died to make menholy, let us die to make
men free,
While God is marching on.
