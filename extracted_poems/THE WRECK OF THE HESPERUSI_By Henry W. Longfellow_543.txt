THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUSI
By Henry W. Longfellow
T was the schooner Hesperus That sailed the wintry sea;
And the skipper had taken his little daughter To bear him company.
Blue were her eyes as the fairy- flax,
Her cheeks like the dawn of day,
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,
That ope in the month of May.
The skipper he stood beside the helm,
His pipe was in his mouth,
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
The smoke now west, now south.
Then up and spake an old sail√≤r Hadsailed to the Spanish main,
" I pray thee put into yonder port,
For I fear a hurricane.
"Last night the moon had a golden ring,
And to-night no moon we see!"
The skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe,
And a scornful laugh laughed he.
Colder and colder blew the wind,
Agale from the northeast;
The snow fell hissing in the brine,
And the billows frothed like yeast.
