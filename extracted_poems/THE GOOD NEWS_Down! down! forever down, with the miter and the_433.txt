THE GOOD NEWS
Down! down! forever down, with the miter and the
crown!
With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of
the Pope!
There is woe in Oxford halls, there is wail in Durham's stalls ;
The Jesuit smites his bosom, the bishop rends his
cope.
And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's
ills,
And tremble when she thinks on the edge ofEng- land's sword;
And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear
What the hand of God hath wrought for the houses and the word!
