WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
Then the maiden clasped herhands and prayed That sav√®d she might be;
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the waves
On the Lake of Galilee.
And fast through the midnight dark and drear,
Through the whistling sleet and snow,
Like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept Towards the reef of Norman's Woe.
And ever the fitful gusts between Asound came from the land;
It was the sound of the trampling surf On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
The breakers were right beneath her bows,
She drifted a dreary wreck,
And awhooping billow swept the crew Like icicles from her deck.
She struck where the white and fleecy waves
Looked soft as carded wool,
But the cruel rocks they gored her side
Like the horns of an angry bull.
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,
With the masts went by the board;
Like a vessel of glass she stove and sank- Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach A fisherman stood aghast To see the form of a maiden fair
Lashed close to adrifting mast.
