THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then in his stirrups up he stood,
So lion-like and bold,
Andheld the precious heart aloft
All in its case of gold.
He flung it from him, far ahead,
And never spake he more,
But "Pass thou first, thou dauntless heart,
As thou wert wont of yore ! "
The roar of fight rose fiercer yet,
And heavier still the stour,
Till the spears of Spain came shivering in,
And swept away the Moor.
"Now praised be God, the day is won!
They fly o'er flood and fell- Why dost thou draw the rein so hard,
Good knight, that fought so well?"
"O, ride ye on, Lord King!" he said,
"And leave the dead to me,
For I must keep the dreariest watch
That ever I shall dree !
"There lies, above his master's heart,
The Douglas, stark and grim;
And woe is me I should be here,
Not side by side with him!
"The world grows cold, myarm is old,
And thin my lyart hair,
And all that I loved best on earth
Is stretched before me there.
