THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"Now, by thy knightly faith, I pray,
Sir Simon of the LeeFor truer friend had never man
Than thou hast been to me-
"If ne'er upon the Holy Land 'Tis mine in life to tread,
Bear thou to Scotland's kindly earth The relics of her dead. "
The tear was in Sir Simon's eye As he wrung the warrior's hand-
"Betide me weal, betide me woe,
I'll hold by thy command.
"But if in battle-front, Lord James,
'Tis ours once more to ride,
Nor force of man, nor craft of fiend,
Shall cleave me from thy side!"
And aye we sailed and aye we sailed
Across the weary sea,
Until one morn the coast of Spain
Rose grimly on our lee.
And as we rounded to the port,
Beneath the watch-tower's wall,
We heard the clash of the atabals,
And the trumpet's wavering call.
"Why sounds yon Eastern music here
So wantonly and long,
And whose the crowd of armed men
That round yon standard throng?"
