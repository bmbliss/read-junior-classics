LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE
An' onc't when they was "company," an' old folks
was there,
She mocked 'em an' shocked 'em, an' said she
didn't care!
An' thist as she kicked her heels, an' turn't to run
an' hide,
They was two great big Black Things a-standin'
byher side,
An' they snatched her through the ceilin' 'fore she knowed what she's about!
An' the Gobble-uns'll git you Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
An' little Orphant Annie says, when the blaze is blue,
An' the lampwick sputters, an' the wind goes woo-oo !
An' youhearthe crickets quit, an' the moon is gray,
An' the lightnin' -bugs indewis all squenched away- You better mindyer parents, an' yer teachers fond an' dear,
An' churish them 'at loves you, an' dry the or- phant's tear,
An' he'p the pore an' needy ones 'at clusters all about,
Er the Gobble-uns'll git you
Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
