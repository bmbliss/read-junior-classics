THE HAND OF LINCOLN
By Edmund Clarence Stedman
OOK on this cast and know the hand
That bore a nation in its hold :
From this mute witness understand
What Lincoln was-how large of mould.
The man who sped the woodman's team,
Anddeepest sunk the ploughman's share,
Andpushed the laden raft astream,
Of fate before him unaware.
This was the hand that knew to swing The axe-since thus would Freedom train
Her son-and made the forest ring,
Anddrove the wedge and toiled amain.
Firmhand, that loftier office took,
Aconscious leader's will obeyed,
And, when men sought his word and look,
With steadfast might the gathering swayed.
