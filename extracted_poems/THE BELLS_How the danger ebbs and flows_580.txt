THE BELLS
How the danger ebbs and flows ;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bellsOf the bellsOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsIn the clamor and the clangor of the bells.
Hear the tolling of the bells- Iron bells !
What a world of solemn thought their monody
compels !
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone !
For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people-ah, the people- They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stoneThey are neither man nor woman- They are neither brute nor human- They are Ghouls :
