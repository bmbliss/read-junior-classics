UTSTRETCHED
shade
beneath the leafy
Of Windsor forest's deepest glade,
Adying woman lay;
Three little children round her stood,
And there went up from the greenwood Awoful wail that day.
"O mother! " was the mingled cry, "
â€œO mother, mother ! do not die,
And leave us all alone."
"My blessed babes!" she tried to say,
But the faint accents died away In a low sobbing moan.
Andthen, life struggling hard with death,
And fast and strong she drew her breath,
And up she raised her head;
And, peering through the deep wood maze
With a long, sharp, unearthly gaze,
"Will she not come?" she said.
Just then, the parting boughs between,
Alittle maid's light form was seen,
All breathless with her speed;
And, following close, aman came on
(A portly man to look upon) ,
Who led a panting steed.
