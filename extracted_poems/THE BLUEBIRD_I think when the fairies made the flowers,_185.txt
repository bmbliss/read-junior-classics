THE BLUEBIRD
I think when the fairies made the flowers,
To grow in these mossy fields of ours,
Periwinkles and violets rare,
There was left of the spring's own color, blue,
Plenty to fashion a flower whose hue
Would be richer than all and as fair.
So, putting their wits together, they Made one great blossom so bright and gay,
The lily beside it seemed blurred;
And then they said, "Wewill toss it in air ;
So many blue blossoms grow everywhere,
Let this pretty one be a bird!"
