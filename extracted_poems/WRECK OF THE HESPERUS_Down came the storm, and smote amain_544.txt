WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
Down came the storm, and smote amain
The vessel in its strength ;
She shuddered and paused likeafrightenedsteed,
Then leaped her cable's length.
"Come hither ! come hither ! my little daught√®r,
And do not tremble so ;
For I can weather the roughest gale
That ever wind did blow. "
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat Against the stinging blast;
He cut a rope from a broken spar,
And bound her to the mast.
"O father ! I hear the church-bells ring;
Oh say, what may it be?"
" 'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"
And he steered for the open sea.
"O father! I hear the sound of guns;
Oh say, what may it be?"
"Some ship in distress, that cannot live
In such an angry sea! "
"O father! I see agleaming light;
Oh say, what may it be?"
But the father answered never a word,
A frozen corpse was he.
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,
With his face turned to the skies,
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
On his fixed and glassy eyes.
