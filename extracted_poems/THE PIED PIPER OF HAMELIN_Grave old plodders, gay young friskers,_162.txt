THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails, and pricking whiskers,
Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wivesFollowed the Piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped, advancing,
And step for step they followed dancing,
Until they came to the River Weser,
Wherein all plunged and perished!
-Save one, who stood as Julius CÃ¦sar,
Swam across and lived to carry
(As he, the manuscript he cherished)
To Rat-land home his commentary :
Which was, "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,
Iheard a sound as of scraping tripe,
And putting apples, wondrous ripe,
Into a cider-press's gripe :
Andmoving away of pickle-tub boards,
And aleaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,
And adrawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,
Andabreaking the hoops of butter-casks:
And it seemed as if a voice
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice !
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'
Andjust as a bulky sugar-puncheon,
All ready staved, like agreat sun shone Glorious, scarce an inch before me,
Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore mel -Ifound the Weser rolling o'er me."
