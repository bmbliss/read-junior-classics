IVRY
Oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long
array ;
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel
peers,
And Appenzell's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses
of our land;
Anddark Mayenne was in the midst, atruncheon in his hand;
And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,
Andgood Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,
To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.
The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor
drest,
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.
He looked upon his people, and atear was in his
eye;
He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.
Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,
Down all our line, a deafening shout, "God save our Lord the King!"
