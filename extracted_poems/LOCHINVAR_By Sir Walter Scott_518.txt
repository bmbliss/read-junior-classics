LOCHINVAR
By Sir Walter Scott
H, young Lochinvar is come out of the West;
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
Andsave his good broadswordheweapons hadnone;
He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for
stone;
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and adastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
