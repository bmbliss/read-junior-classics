THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"For I've often heard it said,
They never, never wake again
Who sleep upon your bed."
Said the cunning spider to the fly,
"Dear friend, what shall I do
To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?
I have within my pantry Good store of all that's nice ;
I'm sure you're very welcome- Willyou please to take a slice?"
"Oh, no, no! " said the little fly,
"Kind sir, that cannot be;
I've heard what's in your pantry,
And I do not wish to see."
"Sweet creature," said the spider,
"You're witty and you're wise ;
How handsome are your gauzy wings,
How brilliant are your eyes.
I have a little looking-glass Upon my parlor shelf ;
If you'll step in one moment, dear,
You shall behold yourself."
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,
"For what you're pleased to say,
And bidding you good-morning, now,
I'll call another day."
The spider turned him round about,
And went into his den,
