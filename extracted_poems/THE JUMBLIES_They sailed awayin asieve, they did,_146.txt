THE JUMBLIES
They sailed awayin asieve, they did,
In a sieve they sailed so fast,
With only a beautiful pea-green veil Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,
To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
And every one said who saw them go,
"Oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?
For the sky is so dark, and the voyage is long;
And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong In a sieve to sail so fast."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
The water it soon came in, it did,
The water it soon came in;
So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
In a pinky paper all folded neat;
And they fastened it down with a pin.
And they passed the night in a crockery jar ;
And each of them said: "How wise we are!
Though the sky be dark and the voyage long Yet we never can think we were rash or
wrong,
While round in our sieve we spin."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
