SEVEN TIMES ONE
"Cricket, good-by, we've been friends so long ;
Little brook, sing us your farewell song;
Say you are sorry to see us go;
Ah, you will miss us, right well we know.
"Dear little lambs in your fleecy fold,
Mother will keep you from harm and cold ;
Fondly we watched you in vale and glade,
Say, will you dream of our loving shade?"
Dancing and whirling, the little Leaves went,
Winter had called them, and they were content ;
Soon, fast asleep in their earthy beds,
The snow laid a coverlid over their heads.
