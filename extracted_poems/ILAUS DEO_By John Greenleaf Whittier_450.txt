ILAUS DEO
By John Greenleaf Whittier
T is done!
Clang of bell and roar of gun
Send the tidings up and down.
How the belfries rock and reel !
How the great guns, peal on peal,
Fling the joy from town to town!
Ring, O bells !
Every stroke exulting tells Of the burial hour of crime.
Loud and long, that all may hear,
Ring for every listening ear Of Eternity and Time!
Let us kneel :
God's own voice is in that peal,
And this spot is holy ground.
Lord, forgive us! What are we,
That our eyes this glory see,
That our ears have heard the sound!
