HEAVING OF THE LEADF
By Charles Dibdin
OR England when with favoring gale
Our gallant ship up channel steered,
And, scudding under easy sail,
The high blue western land appeared;
To heave the lead the seaman sprung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the deep-nine !"
Andbearing up to gain the port,
Some well-known object kept in view- An abbey- tower, a harbor-fort,
Or beacon to the vessel true;
While oft the lead the seaman flung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the mark-seven ! "
