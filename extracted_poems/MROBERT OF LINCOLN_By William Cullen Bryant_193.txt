MROBERT OF LINCOLN
By William Cullen Bryant
ERRILY swinging on brier and weed,
Near to the nest of his little dame,
Over the mountain-side or mead,
Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Snug and safe is this nest of ours,
Hidden among the summer flowers.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln is gayly dressed,
Wearing a bright, black wedding-coat ;
White are his shoulders, and white his crest,
Hear him call in his merry note,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Look what a nice, new coat is mine;
Sure there was never abird so fine.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,
Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,
Passing at home a patient life,
Broods in the grass while her husband sings Bob-o'-link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Brood, kind creature, you need not fear Thieves and robbers while I am here.
Chee, chee, chee.
