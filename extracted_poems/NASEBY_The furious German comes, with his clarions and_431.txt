NASEBY
The furious German comes, with his clarions and
his drums,
His bravoes of Alsatia and pages of Whitehall ;
They are bursting on our flanks ! Grasp your
pikes! Close your ranks !
For Rupert never comes but to conquer, or to fall.
They are here they rush on-we are broken-we
are gone- Our left is borne before them like stubble on the
blast.
O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right!
Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to
the last!
Stout Skippen hath a wound-the center hath given ground.
Hark! hark! what means the trampling of horse- men on our rear ?
Whosebanner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God!
'tis he, boys !
Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here!
Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a
row,
Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the
dikes.
Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the
accurst,
And at a shock have scattered the forest of his
pikes.
