MOTHER HUBBARD
She went to the ale-house
To get him some beer,
But when she got back The dog sat in achair.
She went to the tavern
::
For white wine and red,
But when she came back
The dog stood on his head.
She went to the hatter's
To buy him
a hat
,
But when she came back
He was feeding the cat
.
She went to the barber's
To buy him
a wig
,
But when she came back
He was dancing
a jig
.
She went to the fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit,
But when she came back
He was playing the flute.
She went to the tailor's
To buy him
a coat,
But when she came back
.
He was riding
agoat
.
She went to the cobbler's
To buy him some shoes
,
But when she came back
He was reading the news
.
