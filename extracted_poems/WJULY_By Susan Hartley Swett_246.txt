WJULY
By Susan Hartley Swett
WHEN the scarlet cardinal tells
Her dream to the dragon fly,
Andthe lazy breeze makes a nest in the trees
And murmurs alullaby,
It is July.
When the tangled cobweb pulls The cornflower's cap awry,
And the lilies tall lean over the wall
To bow to the butterfly,
It is July.
