T
By Edward Lear
HE Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat ;
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the moonabove,
Andsang to a small guitar :
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are !"
Pussy said to the Owl: "You elegant fowl,
How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh, let us be married-too long wehave
tarriedBut what shall we do for a ring?"
They sailed away for ayear and aday
To the land where the bong tree grows ;
And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose.
With a ring at the end of his nose.
