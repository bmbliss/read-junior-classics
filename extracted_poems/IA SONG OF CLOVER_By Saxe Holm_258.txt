IA SONG OF CLOVER
By Saxe Holm
WONDER what the Clover thinks,
Intimate friend of Bob-o' -links,
Lover of Daisies slim and white,
Waltzer with Buttercups at night ;
Keeper of Inn for travelling Bees,
Serving to them wine-dregs and lees,
Left by the Royal Humming Birds,
Who sip and pay with fine-spun words;
