TO A SKYLARK
Higher still and higher From the earth thou springest:
Like a cloud of fire,
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,
Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight,
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delightKeen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere
Whose intense lamp narrows In the white dawn clear,
Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.
All the earth and air
With they voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd.
