THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then down we went, a hundred knights,
All in our dark array,
And flung our armor in the ships
That rode within the bay.
We spoke not as the shore grew less
But gazed in silence back,
Where the long billows swept away
The foam behind our track.
And aye the purple hues decayed Upon the fading hill,
And but one heart in all that ship
Was tranquil, cold, and still.
The good Lord Douglas paced the deck,
And O, his face was wan!
Unlike the flush it used to wear
When in the battle-van.-
"Come hither, come hither, my trustyknight,
Sir Simon of the Lee ;
There is a freit lies near my soul I fain would tell to thee.
"Thouknow'st the words King Robert spoke Upon his dying day:
How he bade take his noble heart
And carry it far away;
"And lay it in the holy soil Where once the Saviour trod,
Since he might not bear the blessed Cross,
Nor strike one blow for God.
