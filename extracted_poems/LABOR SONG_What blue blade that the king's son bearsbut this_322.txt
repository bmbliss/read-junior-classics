LABOR SONG
What blue blade that the king's son bearsbut this
Blunt thing-!" he snapt and flung it from his
hand,
And lowering crept away and left the field.
Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,
Andweaponless, and saw the broken sword,
Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,
And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout
Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,
Andsaved a great cause that heroic day.
