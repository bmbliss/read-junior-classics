TO A SKYLARK
What thou art we know not ;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see As from thy presence showers arain of melody:-
Like a poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like ahigh-born maiden
In a palace tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love which overflows her
bower:
Like a glow-worm golden In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aërial hue
Among the flowers and grass which screen it from
the view:
Like a rose embowered
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives Makes faint with too much sweet these heavywingèd thieves.
