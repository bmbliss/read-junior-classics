THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
You should have heard the Hamelin people Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.
"Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles,
Poke out the nests, and block up the holes!
Consult with carpenters and builders,
And leave in our town not even a trace
Of the rats ! " When suddenly, up the face Of the Piper perked in the market-place,
With a, "First, if you please, my thousand guilders !"
Athousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;
So did the Corporation, too.
For council dinners made rare havoc
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;
And half the money would replenish Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.
To pay this sum to awandering fellow,
With agypsy coat of red andyellow!
"Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,
"Our business was done at the river's brink;
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.
So friend, we're not the folks to shrink From the duty of giving you something to drink,
And a matter of money to put in your poke;
But, as for the guilders, what we spoke Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty.
thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!
