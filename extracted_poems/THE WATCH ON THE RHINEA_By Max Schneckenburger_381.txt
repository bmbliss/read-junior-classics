THE WATCH ON THE RHINEA
By Max Schneckenburger
VOICE resounds like thunder peal,
'Middashingwaveandclang ofsteel;
"The Rhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine!
Who guards to-day my stream divine?"
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine,
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine ;
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine,
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch
the Rhine.
