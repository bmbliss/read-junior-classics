THE WIND AND THE MOON
By George MacDonald
AID the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out!
You stare
In the air
As if crying 'Beware,'
Always looking what I am about :
I hate to be watched; I will blow you out !
The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.
So, deep
On a heap
Of clouds, to sleep,
Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon,
Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon!"
He turned in his bed: she was there again!
Onhigh
In the sky,
With her one ghost-eye The Moon shone white and alive and plain:
Said the Wind, "I will blow you out again!"
