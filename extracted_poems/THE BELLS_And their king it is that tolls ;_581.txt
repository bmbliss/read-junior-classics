THE BELLS
And their king it is that tolls ;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
Rolls
Apæan from the bells !
And his merry bosom swells With the pæan of the bells !
And he dances and he yells ;
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pean of the bells- Of the bells :
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the sobbing of the bells,
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In ahappy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells- Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
