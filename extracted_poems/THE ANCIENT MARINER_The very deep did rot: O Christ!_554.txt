THE ANCIENT MARINER
The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.
About, about, in reel and rout
The death- fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.
And some in dreams assur√®d were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so,
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.
Andevery tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root ;
We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot.
Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.
