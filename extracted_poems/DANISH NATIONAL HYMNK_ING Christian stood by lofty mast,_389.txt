DANISH NATIONAL HYMNK
ING Christian stood by lofty mast,
In mist and smoke.
His sword was hammering so fast,
Thro' Gothic helm and brain it pass'd,
Then sank each hostile hulk and mast,
In mist and smoke.
"Fly," shouted they; "fly he who can!
Who braves of Denmark's Christian,
Who braves of Denmark's Christian the
stroke."
Nils Juel gave heed to th' tempest's roar,
Now is the hour!
He hoisted his blood-red flag once more,
And smote upon the foe full sore,
Andshouted loud thro' the tempest's roar,
"Now is the hour."
"Fly!" shouted they, "for shelter fly !
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy,
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy the power?"
