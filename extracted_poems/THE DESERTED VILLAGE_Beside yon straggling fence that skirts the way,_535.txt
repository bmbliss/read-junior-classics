THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
The village master taught his little school.
Aman severe he was, and stern to view;
I knew him well, and every truant knew:
Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace The day's disasters in his morning face;
Full well they laugh'd, with counterfeited glee,
At all his jokes, for many ajoke had he;
Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd:
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,
The love he bore to learning was in fault.
The village all declared how much he knew;
'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
And e'en the story ran-that he could gauge:
Inarguing, too, the parson own'd his skill,
For ev'n though vanquish'd he could argue still ;
While words of learned length, and thund'ring sound,
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew That one small head could carry all he knew.
But past is all his fame. The very spot Wheremany atime he triumph'd, is forgot.
Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,
Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,
Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts in- spired,
Where graybeard mirth, and smiling toil retired,
