THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,
And Piper and dancers were gone forever,
They made a decree that lawyers never Should think their records dated duly
If, after the day of the month and the year,
These words did not as well appear :
"And so long after what happened here
On the Twenty-second of July,
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six."
And the better in memory to fix
The place of the children's last retreat,
They called it the Pied Piper's StreetWhere any one playing on pipe or tabor Was sure for the future to lose his labor.
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
But opposite the place of the cavern
They wrote the story on a column,
And on the great church-window painted
The same, to make the world acquainted How their children were stolen away,
And there it stands to this very day.
And I must not omit to say
That in Transylvania there's a tribe
Of alien people who ascribe The outlandish ways and dress On which their neighbors lay such stress,
To their fathers and mothers having risen
Out of some subterraneous prison Into which they were trepanned Long ago in amighty band Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,
But how or why, they don't understand.
