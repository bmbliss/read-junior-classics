THE ANCIENT MARINER
The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,
"Why, this is strange, I trow!
Where are those lights so many andfair,
That signal made but now?"
"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said- "And they answered not our cheer!
The planks looked warped! and see those sails,
How thin they are and sere!
I never saw aught like to them,
Unless perchance it were
"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
My forest-brook along;
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,
Andthe owlet whoops to the wolf below,
That eats the she-wolf's young."
"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look-
(The Pilot made reply)
I am a-feared"-"Push on, push on!"
Said the Hermit cheerily.
The boat came closer to the ship,
But I nor spake nor stirred;
The boat came close beneath the ship,
And straight a sound was heard.
Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread:
It reached the ship, it split the bay;
The ship went down like lead.
