PART
Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,
Beloved from pole to pole!
To Mary Queen the praise be given!
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,
That slid into my soul.
The silly buckets on the deck,
That had so long remained,
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
And when I awoke, it rained.
My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
Andstill mybody drank.
I moved, and could not feel my limbs :
I was so light-almost I thought that I had died in sleep,
Andwas ablessed ghost.
And soon I heard aroaring wind:
It did not come anear;
