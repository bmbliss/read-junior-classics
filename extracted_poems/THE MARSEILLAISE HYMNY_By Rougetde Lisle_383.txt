THE MARSEILLAISE HYMNY
By Rougetde Lisle
Esons of freedom, wake to glory !
Hark! hark ! what myriads bid you rise !
Your childen, wives, and grandsires hoary,
Behold their tears and hear their cries !
Shall hateful tyrants, mischiefs breeding,
With hireling hosts, a ruffian band,
Affright and desolate the land,
While peace and liberty lie bleeding?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! all hearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling,
Which treacherous kings confederate raise ;
The dogs of war, let loose, are howling,
And lo! our fields and cities blaze;
And shall we basely view the ruin,
While lawless force, with guilty stride,
Spreads desolation far and wide,
With crimes and blood his hands embruing?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! allhearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
O Liberty! can man resign thee,
Once having felt thy generous flame?
Candungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee?
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?
