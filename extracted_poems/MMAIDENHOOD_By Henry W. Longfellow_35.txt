MMAIDENHOOD
By Henry W. Longfellow
AIDEN! with the meek, brown eyes,
In whose orbs ashadow lies
Like the dusk in evening skies !
Thou whose locks outshine the sun,
Golden tresses, wreathed in one,
As the braided streamlets run!
Standing, with reluctant feet,
Where the brook and river meet,
Womanhood and childhood fleet !
Gazing, with a timid glance,
Onthe brooklet's swift advance,
On the river's broad expanse!
Deep and still, that gliding stream Beautiful to thee must seem,
As the river of adream.
