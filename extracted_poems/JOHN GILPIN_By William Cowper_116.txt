JOHN GILPIN
By William Cowper
OHN GILPIN was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
Atrain-band captain eke was he
Of famous London Town.
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
"Though wedded we have been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we No holiday have seen.
"To-morrow is our wedding-day,
Andwe will then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton,
All in achaise and pair.
