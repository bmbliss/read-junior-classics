TO THE FRINGED GENTIANT
By William Cullen Bryant
HOU blossom, bright with autumn dew,
Andcolored with the heaven's own blue,
That openest when the quiet light
Succeeds the keen and frosty night,
Thou comest not when violets lean
O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
Or columbines, in purple dressed,
Nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest.
