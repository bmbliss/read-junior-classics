HERVE RIEL
Not a ship that misbehaves, not akeel that grates the ground,
Not a spar that comes to grief!
The peril, see, is past,
All are harbored to the last,
Andjust as HervéRielhollas "Anchor !" sure asfate Up the English come, too late !
So the storm subsides to calm:
They see the green trees wave
On the heights o'erlooking Grève.
Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.
"Just our rapture to enchance,
Let the English rake the bay,
Gnash their teeth and glare askance,
As they cannonade away!
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"
Howhope succeeds despair oneach Captain's countenance!
Out burst all with one accord,
"This is Paradise for Hell!
Let France, let France's King Thank the man that did the thing!"
What a shout, and all one word,
"Hervé Riel!"
As he stepped in front once more,
Not a symptom of surprise In the frank blue Breton eyes,
Just the same man as before.
Then said Damfreville, "My friend,
I must speak out at the end,
Though I find the speaking hard.

HERVE RIEL 1
Praise is deeper than the lips :
You have saved the King his ships,
You must name your own reward.
'Faith our sun was near eclipse!
Demand whate'er you will,
France remains your debtor still.
'Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville. "
Then abeam of fun outbroke
On the bearded mouth that spoke,
As the honest heart laughed through
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
"Since I needs must say my say,
Since on board the duty's done,
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is
it but a run ?-
Since 'tis ask and have, I may- Since the others go ashoreCome! Agood whole holiday!
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore! "
That he asked and that he got nothing more.
Name and deed alike are lost :
Not a pillar nor a post In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
Not a head in white and black
On a single fishing-smack,
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
All that France saved from the fight whence
England bore the bell.
