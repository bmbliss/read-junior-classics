THE WIND IN A FROLIC
So on it went capering and playing its pranks,
Whistling with reeds on the broad river's banks,
Puffing the birds as they sat on the spray,
Or the traveller grave on the king's highway.
It was not too nice to hustle the bags
Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags ;
'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke With the doctor's wig or the gentleman's cloak.
Through the forest it roared, and cried gaily, "Now,
You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"
And it made them bow without more ado,
Or it cracked their great branches through and through.
Then it rushed like a monster oncottage and farm,
Striking their dwellers with sudden alarm;
And they ran out like bees in a midsummer
swarm;-
There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over
their caps,
To see if their poultry were free from mishaps ;
Theturkeys theygobbled, the geese screamed aloud,
And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;
There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on,
Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to
be gone.
But the wind had swept on, and had met in a lane
Withaschoolboy, who panted and struggled invain;
For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and
he stood
With his hat in a pool and his shoes in the mud.
