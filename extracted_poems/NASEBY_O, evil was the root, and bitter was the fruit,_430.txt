NASEBY
O, evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit,
And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod;
For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong,
Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God.
It was about the noon of a glorious day of
June
That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses
shine,
And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair,
And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine.
Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his
sword,
The General rode along us to form us for the
fight ;
When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled
into a shout
Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right.
And hark! like the roar of the billows on the
shore,
The cry of battle rises along their charging line :
For God! for the cause! for the Church ! for the
laws!
For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the
Rhine!
