JOHN GILPIN
"My sister and my sister's child,
Myself, and children three,
Will fill the chaise ; so you must ride On horseback after we."
He soon replied, "I do admire Of womankind but one,
And you are she, my dearest dear,
Therefore it shall be done.
"I am a linendraper bold,
As all the world doth know,
Andmy good friend, the Calender,
Will lend his horse to go."
Quoth Mistress Gilpin, "That's well said;
And, for that wine is dear,
Wewill be furnish'd with our own,
Which is both bright and clear."
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;
O'erjoy'd was he to find
That, though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.
The morning came, the chaise was brought,
But yet was not allow'd To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog To dash through thick and thin.
