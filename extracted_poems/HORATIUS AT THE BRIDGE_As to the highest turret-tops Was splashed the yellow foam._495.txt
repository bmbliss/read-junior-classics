HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
As to the highest turret-tops Was splashed the yellow foam.
And like a horse unbroken,
When first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard,
And tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb, and bounded,
Rejoicing to be free ;
Andwhirling down, in fierce career,
Battlement and plank and pier,
Rushed headlong to the sea.
Alone stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mindThrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus,
With a smile on his pale face ;
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena,
"Now yield thee to our grace!"
Round turned he, as not deigning Those craven ranks to see ;
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus naught spake he ;
But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river That rolls by the towers of Rome:
"OTiber! Father Tiber !
To whom the Romans pray,
