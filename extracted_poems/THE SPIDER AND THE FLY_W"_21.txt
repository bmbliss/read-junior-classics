THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
W"
By Mary Howitt
ILL you walk into my parlor?"
aspider to a fly;
" Tis the prettiest little parlor That ever you did spy.
The way into my parlor.
Is up a winding stair,
And I have many pretty things To show when you are there."
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"To ask me is in vain;
For who goes up your winding stair Can ne'er come down again."
"I'm sure you must be weary With soaring up so high;
Will you rest upon mylittle bed?"
Said the spider to the fly.
"There are pretty curtains drawn around,
The sheets are fine and thin;
And if you like to rest awhile,
I'll snugly tuck you in. "
