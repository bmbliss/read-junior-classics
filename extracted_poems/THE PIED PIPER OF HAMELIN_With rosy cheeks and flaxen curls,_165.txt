THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood As if they were changed into blocks of wood,
Unable to move a step, or cry To the children merrily skipping by,
-Could only follow with the eye
That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
And now the Mayor was on the rack,
And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,
As the Piper turned from the High Street
To where the Weser rolled its waters
Right in the way of their sons and daughters !
However, he turned from south to west,
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,
And after him the children pressed;
Great was the joy in every breast.
"Henever can cross that mighty top !
He's forced to let the piping drop,
And we shall see our children stop !"
When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,
Awondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,
Andwhen all were in to the very last,
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
Did I say all? No! One was lame,
Andcould not dance the whole of the way;
And in after years, if you would blame His sadness, he was used to say154
