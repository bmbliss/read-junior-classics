TO A SKYLARK
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet, if we could scorn,
Hate and pride, and fear;
If we were things born Not to shed a tear,
Iknow not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Ofdelightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know;
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow The world should listen then as I am listening now
