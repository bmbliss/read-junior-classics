THE FLOWERS
"Stop thief !-stop thief !-a highwayman! "
Not one of them was mute ;
Andall and each that pass'd that way Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gates again Flew open in short space:
The toll-men thinking as before That Gilpin rode a race.
And so he did, and won it too!
Forhe got first to town;
Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
Hedid again get down.
-Now let us sing, Long live the King,
And Gilpin, long live he;
And, when he next doth ride abroad,
May I be there to see!
