THE ANCIENT MARINER
Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote,
Like one that hath been sevendays drowned My body lay afloat;
But swift as dreams, myself I found Within the Pilot's boat.
Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,
The boat spun round and round;
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.
I moved my lips-the Pilot shrieked And fell down in a fit ;
The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
Andprayed where he did sit.
I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,
Laughed loud and long, andallthe while His eyes went to and fro.
"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,
The Devil knows how to row."
And now, all in my own countree,
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepped forth fromthe boat,
And scarcely he could stand.
"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"
The Hermit crossed his brow.
"Say quick, " quoth he, "I bid thee say- What manner of man art thou?"
