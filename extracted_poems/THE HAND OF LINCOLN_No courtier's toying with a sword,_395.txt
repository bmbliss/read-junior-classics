THE HAND OF LINCOLN
No courtier's toying with a sword,
Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute;
A chief's, uplifted to the Lord
When all the kings of earth were mute!
The hand of Anak, sinewed strong,
The fingers that on greatness clutch;
Yet, lo! the marks their lines along Of one who strove and suffered much.
For here in knotted cord and vein
I trace the varying chart of years ;
Iknow the troubled heart, the strain,
The weight of Atlas-and the tears.
Again I see the patient brow
That palm erewhile was wont to press ;
Andnow 'tis furrowed deep, and now
Made smooth with hope and tenderness.
For something of aformless grace
This moulded outline plays about;
Apitying flame, beyond our trace,
Breathes like a spirit, in and outThe love that cast an aureole
Round one who, longer to endure,
Called mirth to ease his ceaseless dole,
Yet kept his nobler purpose sure.
Lo, as I gaze, the statured man,
Built up from yon large hand, appears:
Atype that nature wills to plan
But once in all a people's years.
