THE LANDING OF THE PILGRIMFATHERS IN NEW ENGLANDT
By Felicia Dorothea Hemans
HE breaking waves dash'd high Onastern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky Their giant branches toss'd ;
And theheavy night hungdark The hills and waters o'er,
When aband of exiles moor'd their bark
Onthe wild New England shore,
