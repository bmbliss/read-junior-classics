THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!
I can't forget that I'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see,
Which the Piper also promised me.
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,
Joining the town and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
Andeverything was strange and new;
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks
here,
And their dogs outran our fallow deer,
Andhoney-bees had lost their stings,
And horses were born with eagles' wings;
And just as I became assured Mylame foot would be speedily cured,
The music stopped, and I stood still,
Andfound myself outside the hill,
Left alone against my will,
To go now limping as before,
And never hear of that country more!"
Alas, alas for Hamelin!
There came into many aburgher's pate A text which says that heaven's gate Opes to the rich at as easy rate As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
The Mayor sent East, West, North and South,
To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,
Wherever it was man's lot to find him,
Silver and gold to his heart's content,
If he'd only return the way he went,
Andbring the children behind him,
