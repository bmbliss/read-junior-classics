THE ANCIENT MARINER
At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist ;
It moved and moved, and took at last
Acertain shape, I wist.
Aspeck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could nor laugh nor wail ;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in,
As they were drinking all.
See! see ! ( I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel !
The western wave was all a-flame,
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun.
