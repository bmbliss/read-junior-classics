SUMMER DAYS
Anonymous
INTER is cold-hearted;
Autumn is a weathercock;
Blown every way:
Summer days for me
When every leaf is on its tree,
When Robin's not a beggar,
And Jenny Wren's a bride,
And larks hang, singing, singing, singing,
Over the wheat-fields wide,
And anchored lilies ride,
And the pendulum spider Swings from side to side.
