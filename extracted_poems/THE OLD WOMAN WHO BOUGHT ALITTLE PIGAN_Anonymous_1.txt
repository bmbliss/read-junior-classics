THE OLD WOMAN WHO BOUGHT ALITTLE PIGAN
Anonymous
Nold womanwas sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked sixpence. "What," said
she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go
to market, and buy a little pig."
As she was coming home, she came to a stile ;
but the pig would not go over the stile.
She went a little further, and she met adog. So she said to the dog-
"Dog, dog, bite pig!
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the dog would not.
