THE ANCIENT MARINER
My life-blood seemed to sip !
The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed
white;
From the sails the dew did drip- Till clomb above the eastern bar
The horned Moon, with one bright star Within the nether tip.
One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
And cursed me with his eye.
Four times fifty living men,
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.
The souls did from their bodies fly- They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul, it passed me by,
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!
