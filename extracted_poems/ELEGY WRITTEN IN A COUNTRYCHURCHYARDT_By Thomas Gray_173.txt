ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRYCHURCHYARDT
By Thomas Gray
HE curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight Anddrowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower The moping owl does to the moon complain Ofsuch as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.
