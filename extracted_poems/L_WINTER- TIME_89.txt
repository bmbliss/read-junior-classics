L
WINTER- TIME
By Robert Louis Stevenson
ATE lies the wintry sun a-bed,
Afrosty, fiery sleepy-head;
Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
Ablood-red orange, sets again.
Before the stars have left the skies,
Atmorning in the dark I rise;
And, shivering in my nakedness,
Bythe cold candle, bathe anddress.
Closeby the jolly fire Isit To warm my frozen bones a bit ;
Or, with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door.
