THE WALRUS

"Aloaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need :
Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeedNow, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
Adismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine, " the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view ?
"It was so kind of you to come!
And you were very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice.
Iwish you were not quite so deafI've had to ask you twice!"
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick! "
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick! "
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes.
