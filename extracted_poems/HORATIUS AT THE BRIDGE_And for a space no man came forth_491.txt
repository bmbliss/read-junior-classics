HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And for a space no man came forth
To win the narrow way.
But, hark ! the cry is Astur :
And lo! the ranks divide ;
And the great lord of Luna Comes with his stately stride.
Upon his ample shoulders Clangs loud the fourfold shield,
And in his hand he shakes the brand
Which none but he can wield.
He smiled on those bold Romans,
A smile serene and high ;
He eyed the flinching Tuscans,
And scorn was in his eye.
Quoth he, " The she-wolf's litter
Stand savagely at bay ;
But will ye dare to follow,
If Astur clears the way? "
Then, whirling up his broadsword With both hands to the height,
He rushed against Horatius,
And smote with all his might.
With shield and blade Horatius
Right deftly turned the blow.
The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh ;
It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh.
The Tuscans raised a joyful cry To see the red blood flow.
