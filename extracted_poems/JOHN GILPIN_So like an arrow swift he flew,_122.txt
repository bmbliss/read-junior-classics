JOHN GILPIN
So like an arrow swift he flew,
Shot by an archer strong;
So did he fly-which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Awaywent Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the Calender's
His horse at last stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbor in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him.
"What news? what news? your tidings tell !
Tell me you must and shallSay, why bare-headed you are come,
Orwhy you come at all?"
NowGilpin had apleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke;
And thus unto the Calender
In merry guise he spoke :
"I came, because your horse would come;
And, if I well forbode,
Myhat and wig will soon be here,
They are uponthe road."
The Calender, right glad to find His friend in merry pin,
Return'd him not asingle word,
But to the house went in;
