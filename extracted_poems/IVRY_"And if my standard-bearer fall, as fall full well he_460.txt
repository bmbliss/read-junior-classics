IVRY
"And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he
may,
For never saw I promise yet of such abloody fray,
Press where ye see mywhite plume shine, amid the ranks of war,
And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled
din
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roar- ing culverin.
The fiery Duke is pricking fast across St. Andr√©'s plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and
Almayne.
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of
France,
Charge for the golden lilies now-upon them with
the lance.
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,
Athousand knights are pressing close behind the snow- white crest ;
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a
guiding star,
Amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of
Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne
hath turned his rein.
D'Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish count is slain.
