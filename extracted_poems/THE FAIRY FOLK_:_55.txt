THE FAIRY FOLK
:
With
a bridge of white mist Columbkill he crosses,
Onhis stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses
;
Or going up with music
,
On cold starry nights
,
To sup with the Queen
Of the gay Northern Lights
.
They stole little Bridget For seven years long;
When she came down again
Her friends were all gone.
They took her lightly back Between the night and morrow
;
They thought that she was fast asleep
,
But she was dead with sorrow
.
They have kept her ever since
Deep within the lakes
,
On
abed of flag leaves
,
Watching till she wakes.
By the craggy hill-side,
Through the mosses bare
,
They have planted thorn trees
For pleasure here and there
.
Isanymanso daring
As dig one up in spite
?
He shall find the thornies set
Inhis bed at night.
Upthe airy mountain,
Down the rushyglen,

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
We daren't go a-hunting For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together;
Green jacket, red cap,
And white owl's feather.
THE VOWELS: AN ENIGMA
