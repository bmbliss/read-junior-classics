THE LOST DOLL
By Charles Kingsley
IONCE The prettiest hadasweet doll little doll, dears,
Her cheeks were so red and white, dears,
And her hair was so charmingly curled.
But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
As I played on the heath one day;
AndI cried for her more than a week, dears,
But I never could find where she lay.
