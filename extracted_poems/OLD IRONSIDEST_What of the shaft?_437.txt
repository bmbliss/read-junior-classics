OLD IRONSIDEST
What of the shaft?
The shaft was cut in England:
Along shaft, a strong shaft,
Barbed and trim and true ;
So we'll drink all together
To the gray goose feather,
And the land where the gray goose flew.
What of the men?
The men were bred in England:
The bowman-the yeomanThe lads of dale and fell.
Here's to you and to you!
To the hearts that are true
And the land where the true hearts dwell.
