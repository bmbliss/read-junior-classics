FROBIN GOODFELLOW
Anonymous
ROM Oberon, in fairy land,
The king of ghosts and shadows there,
Mad Robin I, at his command,
Amsent to view the night-sports here.
What revel rout
Is kept about,
In every corner where I go,
I will o'ersee,
And merry be,
Andmake good sport, with ho, ho, ho!
More swift than lightning can I fly About this airy welkin soon,
And, in aminute's space, descry Each thing that's done below the moon.
There's not a hag
Or ghost shall wag,
Or cry 'ware goblins ! where I go;
But, Robin, I
Their feats will spy,
And send them home with ho, ho, ho!
Whene'er such wanderers I meet,
As from their night-sports they trudge home,
With counterfeiting voice I greet,
And call them on with me to roam;
Through woods, through lakes,
Through bogs, through brakes,
