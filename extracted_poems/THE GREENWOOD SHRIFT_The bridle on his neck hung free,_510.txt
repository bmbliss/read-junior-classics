THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
The bridle on his neck hung free,
With quivering flank and trembling knee,
Pressed close his bonny bay;
Astatelier man, a statelier steed,
Never on greensward paced, I rede,
Than those stood there that day.
So, while the little maiden spoke,
The man, his back against an oak,
Looked on with glistening eye And folded arms, and in his look
Something that, like a sermon-book,
Preached-"All is vanity."
But when the dying woman's face Turned toward him with a wistful gaze,
He stepped to where she lay;
And, kneeling down, bent over her,
Saying, "I am a minister,
My sister ! let us pray."
And well, withouten book or stole,
(God's words were printed onhis soul!)
Into the dying ear He breathed, as 'twere an angel's strain,
The things that unto life pertain,
And death's dark shadows clear.
He spoke of sinner's lost estate,
In Christ renewed, regenerate- Of God's most blest decree,
That not a single soul should die Who turns repentant, with the cry "Be merciful to me."
