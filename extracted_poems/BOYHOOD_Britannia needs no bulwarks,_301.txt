BOYHOOD
Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep;
Her march is o'er the mountain-waves,
Her home is on the deep.
With thunders from her native oak,
She quells the floods belowAs they roar on the shore,
When the stormy winds do blow;
When the battle rages loud and long And the stormy winds do blow.
The meteor flag of England Shall yet terrific burn;
Till danger's troubled night depart,
And the star of peace return.
Then, then, ye ocean warriors !
Oursong and feast shall flow
To the fame of your name,
When the storm has ceased to blow;
When the fiery fight is heard no more And the storm has ceased to blow.
