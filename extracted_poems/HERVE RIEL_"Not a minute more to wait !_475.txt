HERVE RIEL
"Not a minute more to wait !
Let the Captains all and each
Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!
France must undergo her fate.
"Give the word!" But no such word
Was ever spoke or heard;
For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
-A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate-first, second, third?
No such man of mark, and meet
With his betters to compete!
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,
Apoor coasting-pilot he, Hervé Riel the Croisickese.
And, "What mockery or malice have we here?"
cries Hervé Riel :
"Are you mad, you Malouins? Areyou cowards,
fools or rogues ?
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the
soundings, tell On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every
swell
'Twixt the offing here and Grève where the river
disembogues?
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?
Morn and eve, night and day,
Have I piloted your bay,
