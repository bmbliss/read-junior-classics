THE BLUE JAY
By Susan Hartley Swett
BLUE JAY up in the maple tree,
Shaking your throat with such bursts of glee,
How did you happen to be so blue?
Did you steal a bit of the lake for your crest,
And fasten blue violets into your vest?
Tell me, I pray you tell me true!
Did you dip your wings in azure dye,
When April began to paint the sky,
That was pale with the winter's stay?
Orwere you hatched from ablue bell bright,
'Neath the warm, gold breast of a sunbeam light,
Bythe river one blue spring day?
O Blue Jay up in the maple tree,
Atossing your saucy head at me,
With ne'er a word for my questioning,
Pray, cease for amoment your "ting-a-link,"
Andhear when I tell you what I thinkYou bonniest bit of the spring.
