THE ANCIENT MARINER
This seraph-band, each wavedhis hand,
No voice did they impart- No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on myheart.
But soon I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the Pilot's cheer ;
Myhead was turned perforce away,
And I saw a boat appear.
The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was ajoy The dead men could not blast.
I saw a third-I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away The Albatross's blood.
