SMALL BEGINNINGSA
Andbackward flew to her billowy breast,
Like abird that seeketh her mother's nestAnd amother she was and is to me,
For I was born on the open sea.
The waves were white, and red the morn,
In the noisy hour when I was born;
The whale it whistled, the porpoise rolled,
Andthe dolphins bared their backs of gold;
And never was heard such an outcry wild,
As welcomed to life the ocean child.
Ihave lived since then, in calm and strife,
Full fifty summers a rover's life,
Withwealth to spend, and a power to range,
But never have sought or sighed for change:
Anddeath, whenever he comes to me,
Shall come on the wide, unbounded sea!
