THE RAGGEDY MAN
And comes back with porridge-crumbs all round his mouth,
Andhe brushes them off with a Japanese fan,
Whing!
Whann!
What a marvellous man!
What a very remarkably marvellous man!
"And The Manin the Moon," sighed The Raggedy Man,
"Gits!
So!
Sullonesome, you know- Up there by hisse'f sence creation began!
That when I call on him and then come away,
Hegrabs me and holds me and begs me to stay- Till-Well! if it wasn't fer Jimmy-cum-jim,
Dadd!
Limb!
I'd go pardners with him- Jes jump my job here and be pardners with him!"
