THE DESTRUCTION OFSENNACHERIB
By Lord Byron
HE Assyrian came down like awolf on the
fold,
Andhis cohorts were gleaming inpurple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the
sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
Like the leaves of the forest when the Summer is
green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath
blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the
blast,
Andbreathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
