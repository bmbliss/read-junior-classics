THE MAN IN THE MOON
Andin twenty years they all came back- In twenty years or more ;
And every one said, "How tall they've grown!
For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible
Zone,
And the hills of the Chankly Bore."
And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast ;
And every one said, "If we only live,
We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,
To the hills of the Chankly Bore."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
