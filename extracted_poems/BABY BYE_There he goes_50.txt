BABY BYE
There he goes
On his toes,
Tickling Baby's nose.
Spots of red
Dot his head;
Rainbows on his back are spread;
That small speck Is his neck;
See him nod and beck.
I can show you, if you choose,
Where to look to find his shoesThree small pairs,
Made of hairs ;
These he always wears.
Black and brown
Is his gown;
He can wear it upside down;
Itis laced
Round his waist;
I admire his taste.
Yet though tight his clothes are made,
He will lose them, I'm afraid,
If to-night
He gets sight
Of the candle-light.
Inthe sun
Webs are spun;
What if he gets into one?
When it rains
Hecomplains
Onthe window-panes.
