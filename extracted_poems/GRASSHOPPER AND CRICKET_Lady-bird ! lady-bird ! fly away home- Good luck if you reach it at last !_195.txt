GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
Lady-bird ! lady-bird ! fly away home- Good luck if you reach it at last !
The owl's come abroad, and the bat's on the roam,
Sharp set from their Ramazan fast.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeThe fairy bells tinkle afar !
Make haste, or they'll catch you, and harness you
fast
With a cobweb to Oberon's car.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeTo your house in the old willow-tree,
Where your children so dear have invited the ant
And a few cosy neighbors to tea.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away home,
And if not gobbled up by the way,
Nor yoked by the fairies to Oberon's car,
You're in luck-and that's all I've to say.
