THE LEAVES CAME DOWN
"It is very cruel, too,"
Said little Alice Neal;
"I wonder if he knew
How sad the bird would feel?"
Alittle boy hung down his head,
And went and hid behind the bed;
For he stole that pretty nest From poor little yellow-breast;
Andhe felt so full of shame,
He didn't like to tell his name.
