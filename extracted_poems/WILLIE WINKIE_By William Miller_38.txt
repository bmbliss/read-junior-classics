WILLIE WINKIE
By William Miller
EE WILLIE WINKIE rins through WEELWIL
Up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown,
Tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock,
"Are the weans in their bed?-for it's now ten
o'clock. "
Hey, Willie Winkie! are ye comin' ben?
The cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin'
hen,
The doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a
cheep;
But here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa'
asleep.
