DIVINE ODE
And shouted but once more aloud,
"My father ! must I stay?"
While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud,
The wreathing fires made way.
They wrapt the ship in splendor wild.
They caught the flag on high,
And streamed above the gallant child,
Like banners in the sky.
There came a burst of thunder soundThe boy-oh! where was he?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea!
With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
That well had borne their part- But the noblest thing that perished there Was that young faithful heart!
