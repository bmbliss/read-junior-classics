SLEIGH SONG
Slowly she grew-till she filled the night,
And shone
On her throne
In the sky alone,
Amatchless, wonderful, silvery light,
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.
Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I !
With mybreath,
Ingood faith,
I blew her to death!
First blew her away right out of the sky,
Then blew her in: what a strength am I!"
But the Moon she knew naught of the silly affair;
For, high In the sky,
With her one white eye,
Motionless miles above the air,
She never had heard the great Windblare.
