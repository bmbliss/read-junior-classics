THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
Ring out false pride in place andblood,
The civic slander and the spite:
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love ofgood.....
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land- Ring in the Christ that is to be.
