THE ANCIENT MARINER
To walk together to the kirk,
And all together pray,
While each to his great Father bends,
Old men, and babes, and loving friends And youths and maidens gay!
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou Wedding-Guest !
He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast.
He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small ;
For the dear God who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.
The Mariner, whose eye is bright,
Whose beard with age is hoar,
Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest Turned from the bridegroom's door.
He went like one that hath been stunned,
And is of sense forlorn :
Asadder and a wiser man,
He rose the morrow morn.
