TO MILTON
By William Wordsworth
ILTON! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
afen
Of stagnant waters : altar, sword, and pen,
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
Oh! raise us up, return to us again;
Andgive us manners, virtue, freedom, power.
