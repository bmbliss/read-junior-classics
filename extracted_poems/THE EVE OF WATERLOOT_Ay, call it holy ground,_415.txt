THE EVE OF WATERLOOT
Ay, call it holy ground,
The soil where first they trod.
They have left unstain'd what there they foundFreedom to worship God.
THE EVE OF WATERLO0
By Lord Byron
HERE was a sound of revelrybynight,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.
Athousand hearts beat happily; and when Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell :
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising
knell!
Didye not hear it? No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.
Onwith the dance! let joy be unconfined!
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure
meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet !
But hark ! that heavy sound breaks in once
more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before!
Arm! arm! it is it is the cannon's opening roar!
