LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE
An' all us other children, when the supper things
is done,
We set around the kitchen fire an' has the mostest
fun
A-list'nin' to the witch-tales 'at Annie tells about,
An' the Gobble-uns 'at gits you Ef you
Don't
Watch
Out!
Onc't they was a little boy wouldn't say his pray'rsAn' when he went to bed at night, away up-stairs,
His mammy heerd him holler, an' his daddy heerd him bawl,
An' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wasn't
there at all!
An' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby- hole, an' press,
An' seeked him up the chimbly flue, an' ever'- wheres, I guess ;
But all they ever found was thist his pants an'
roundabout!
An' the Gobble-uns'll git you
Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
An one time a little girl 'ud allus laugh an'
An' make fun of ever' one, an' all her blood- grin,
an'-kin,
