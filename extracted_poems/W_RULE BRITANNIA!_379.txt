W
RULE BRITANNIA!
By James Thomson
HEN Britain first, at Heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main,
This was the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sing the strain:
Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!
Britons never will be slaves.
The nations not so blest as thee,
Must, in their turn, to tyrants fall;
Whilst thou shalt flourish, great and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
Rule Britannia! etc.
Still more majestic shalt thou rise,
More dreadful from each foreign stroke,
As the loud blasts that tear thy skies
Serve but to root thy native oak.
Rule Britannia! etc.
