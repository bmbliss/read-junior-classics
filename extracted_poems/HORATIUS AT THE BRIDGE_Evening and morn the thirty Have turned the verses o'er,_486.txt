HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
Evening and morn the thirty Have turned the verses o'er,
Traced from the right on linen white
Bymighty seers of yore
;
And with one voice the thirty
Have their glad answer given
:
"Go forth, go forth
, Lars PorsenaGo forth, beloved of heaven!
Go, and return in glory To Clusium's royal dome,
And hang round Nurscia's altars
The golden shields of Rome
!"
And now hath every city Sent up her tale of men
;
The foot are fourscore thousand
,
The horse are thousands ten
.
Before the gates of Sutrium
Is met the great array
;
Aproud man was Lars Porsena Upon the trysting-day.
Now, from the rock Tarpeian,
Could the wan burghers spy
The line of blazing villages Red in the midnight sky.
The fathers of the city
,
They sat all night and day
,
For every hour some horseman came
With tidings of dismay.
