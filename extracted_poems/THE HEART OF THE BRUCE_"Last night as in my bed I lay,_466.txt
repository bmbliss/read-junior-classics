THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"Last night as in my bed I lay,
I dreamed a dreary dream: -
Methought I saw a Pilgrim stand In the moonlight's quivering beam.
"His robe was of the azure dye,
Snow-white his scattered hairs,
And even such a cross he bore
As good St. Andrew bears.
""Why go ye forth, Lord James,' he said,
'With spear and belted brand?
Why do you take its dearest pledge From this our Scottish land?
" The sultry breeze of Galilee Creeps through its groves of palm,
The olives on the Holy Mount
Stand glittering in the calm.
" But 'tis not there that Scotland's heart
Shall rest by God's decree,
Till the great angel calls the dead To rise from earth and sea!
" Lord James of Douglas, mark my rede!
That heart shall pass once more
In fiery fight against the foe,
As it was wont of yore.
" And it shall pass beneath the Cross,
And save King Robert's vow ;
But other hands shall bear it back,
Not, James of Douglas, thou!'
