THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
He spoke of trouble, pain, and toil,
Endured but for a little while
In patience, faith, and loveSure, in God's own good time, to be Exchanged for an eternity
Of happiness above.
Then, as the spirit ebbed away,
He raised his hands and eyes to pray
That peaceful it might pass ;
And then the orphans' sobs alone Were heard, and they knelt, every one,
Close round on the green grass.
Such was the sight their wandering eyes
Beheld, in heart-struck, mute surprise,
Who reined their coursers back,
Just as they found the long astray,
Who, in the heat of chase that day,
Had wandered from their track.
But each man reined his pawing steed,
And lighted down, as if agreed,
In silence at his side;
And there, uncovered all, they stoodIt was a wholesome sight and good
That day for mortal pride.
For of the noblest of the land
Was that deep-hushed, bareheaded band;
And, central in the ring,
By that dead pauper on the ground,
Her ragged orphans clinging round,
Knelt their anointed king.
