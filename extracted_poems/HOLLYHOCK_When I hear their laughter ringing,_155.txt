HOLLYHOCK
When I hear their laughter ringing,
Then I'm sure as sure can be
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula tree.
For the Dinkey-Bird's bravuras
And staccatos are so sweetHis roulades, appoggiaturas,
And robustos so complete,
That the youth of every nationBe they near or far away- Have especial delectation
In that gladsome roundelay.
Their eyes grow bright and brighter,
Their lungs begin to crow,
Their hearts get light and lighter,
And their cheeks are all aglow;
For an echo cometh bringing
The news to all and me,
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula trec.
