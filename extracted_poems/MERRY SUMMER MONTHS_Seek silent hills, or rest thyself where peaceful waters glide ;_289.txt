MERRY SUMMER MONTHS
Seek silent hills, or rest thyself where peaceful waters glide ;
Or, underneath the shadow vast of patriarchal
tree,
Scan through its leaves the cloudless sky in rapt tranquillity.
The grass is soft, its velvet touch is grateful to the hand;
And, like the kiss of maiden love, the breeze is
sweet and bland;
The daisy and the buttercup are nodding cour- teously;
It stirs their blood with kindest love, to bless and
welcome thee ;
And mark how with thine own thin locks-they
now are silvery grayThat blissful breeze is wantoning, and whispering,
"Be gay!"
There is no cloud that sails along the ocean of yon
sky
melody;
But hath its own winged mariners to give it
Thou seest their glittering fans outspread, all
gleaming like red gold;
And hark! with shrill pipe musical, their merry course they hold.
Godbless them all, those little ones, who, far above
this earth,
Can make a scoff of its mean joys, and vent a
nobler mirth.
