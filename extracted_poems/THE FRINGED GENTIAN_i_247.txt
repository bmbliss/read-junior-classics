THE FRINGED GENTIAN
i
When the heat like a mist veil floats,
And poppies flame in the rye,
And the silver note in the streamlet's throat
Has softened almost to a sigh,
It is July.
When the hours are so still that time
Forgets them, and lets them lie 'Neath petals pink till the night stars wink At the sunset in the sky,
It is July.
When each finger-post by the way
Says that Slumbertown is nigh;
When the grass is tall, and the roses fall,
Andnobody wonders why,
It is July.
