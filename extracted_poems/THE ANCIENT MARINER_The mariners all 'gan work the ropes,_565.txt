THE ANCIENT MARINER
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do;
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools- Wewere a ghastly crew.
The body of my brother's son Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope But he said nought to me.
"I fear thee, ancient Mariner! "
Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest !
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,
Which to their corses came again,
But a troop of spirits blest :
Forwhen it dawned-they dropped their arms And clustered round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowlythrough theirmouths And from their bodies passed.
Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the Sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mixed, now one by one.
Sometimes a-dropping from the sky Iheard the sky-lark sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning!
And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
