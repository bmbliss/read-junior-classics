HTHE BELLS
By Edgar Allan Poe
EAR the sledges with the bellsSilver bells !
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight ;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells !
What aworld of happiness their harmony foretells !
Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight !
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What agush of euphony voluminously wells !
How it swells !
How it dwells
