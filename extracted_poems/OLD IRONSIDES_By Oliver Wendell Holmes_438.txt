OLD IRONSIDES
By Oliver Wendell Holmes
HE mast that Britain strove to bow in vain;
And one who listened to the tale of shame,
Whose heart still answered to that sacred name,
Whose eye still followed o'er his country's tides Thy glorious flag, our brave Old Ironsides !
From yon lone attic, in a summer's morn,
Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn.
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
Andmany an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon's roar;-
