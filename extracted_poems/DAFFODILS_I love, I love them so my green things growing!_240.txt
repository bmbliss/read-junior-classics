DAFFODILS
I love, I love them so my green things growing!
And I think that they love me, without false
showing;
For by many a tender touch, they comfort me so
much,
With the soft mute comfort of green things growing.
A BOY'S PRAYER
By H. C. Beeching
MODwho created me Gâ˜‘ Nimble and light of limb,
In three elements free,
To run, to ride, to swim
Not when the sense is dim,
But now from the heart of joy,
I would remember Him:
Take the thanks of aboy.
