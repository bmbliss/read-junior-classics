LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE
The Chinese plate looked very blue,
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do?"
But the gingham dog and the calico cat
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
Employing every tooth and claw In the awfullest way you ever saw- And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
(Don't fancy I exaggerate!
Igot my news from the Chinese plate! )
Next morning, where the two had sat,
They found no trace of dog or cat ;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away!
But the truth about the cat and pup Is this : they ate each other up!
Nowwhat do you really think of that!
( The old Dutch clock it told me so,
And that is how I came to know. )
