THE WIND IN A FROLIC
By William Howitt
Tinderingsprangu
HE wind one morning sprang up from sleep,
a leap!
Now for a madcap galloping chase!
I'll make a commotion in every place!"
So it swept with a bustle right through a great
town,
Cracking the signs and scattering down Shutters ; and whisking, with merciless squalls,
Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.
There never was heard a lustier shout,
As the apples and oranges trundled about ;
And the urchins that stand with their thievish eyes For ever on watch, ran off each with a prize.
Then away to the field it went, blustering and humming,
Andthe cattle all wondered whatever was coming;
It plucked by the tails the grave matronly cows,
And tossed the colts' manes all over their brows ;
Till, offended at such an unusual salute,
They all turned their backs, and stood sulky and
mute.
