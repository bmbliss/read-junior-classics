WISHING
And I found an angle-worm A-poking up his headHe maybe feeds on seeds and such,
And so I squashed him dead.
A seed's so very small ;
And dirt all looks the sameHow can they know at all The way they ought to aim?
And so I'm waiting 'round
In case of any need;
Afarmer ought to do his best for
Every single seed!
