Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a
jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Andgiving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
Andawaythey all flew like the down of a thistle ;
But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all agood-night !"
