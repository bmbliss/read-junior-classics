YOUNG DANDELION
:
"You may uproot me
From field and from lane,
Trample me, cut meI spring up again.
"I never flinch, sir,
Wherever I dwell ;
Give me an inch, sir,
I'll soon take an ell.
"Drive me from garden In anger and pride,
I'll thrive and harden
By the road-side.
"Not a bit fearful,
Showing my face,
Always so cheerful In every place."
Said young Dandelion,
With a sweet air,
"I have my eye on
Miss Daisy fair.
"Though we may tarry
Till past the cold,
Her I will marry
Ere I grow old.
"I will protect her
From all kinds of harm,
Feed her with nectar,
Shelter her warm.
