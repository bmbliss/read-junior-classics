THE ANCIENT MARINER
The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;
The helmsman steered us through!
"And agood south wind sprung up bebind ,
The Albatross did follow,
And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariners' hollo!
"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine ;
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white Glimmered the white moon-shine."
"God save thee, ancient Mariner !
From the fiends, that plague thee thus !
Why look'st thou so?"-With mycross-bow I shot the Albatross.
