THE ANCIENT MARINER
How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life returned,
I heard and in my soul discerned Two voices in the air.
"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
Byhim who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low
The harmless Albatross.
"The spirit who bideth by himself In the land of mist and snow,
Heloved the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow."
The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quothhe, "The manhath penancedone,
Andpenance more will do."
