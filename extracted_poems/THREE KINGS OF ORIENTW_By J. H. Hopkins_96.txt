THREE KINGS OF ORIENTW
By J. H. Hopkins
E three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder Star.
Born a babe on Bethlehem plain,
Gold we bring to crown him again;
King for ever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.
