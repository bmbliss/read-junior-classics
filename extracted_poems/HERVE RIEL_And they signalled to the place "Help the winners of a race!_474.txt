HERVE RIEL
And they signalled to the place "Help the winners of a race!
Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick- or, quicker still,
Here's the English can and will!"
Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt
on board;
"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these
to pass?" laughed they:
"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,
Shall the Formidable here with her twelve and
eighty guns Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of
twenty tons,
And with flow at full beside?
Now, ' tis slackest ebb of tide.
Reach the mooring? Rather say,
While rock stands or water runs,
Not a ship will leave the bay!"
Then was called a council straight Brief and bitter the debate :
"Here's the English at our heels; would you have
them take in tow
All that's left us of the fleet linked together stern and bow,
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
Better run the ships aground!"
(Ended Damfreville his speech. )
