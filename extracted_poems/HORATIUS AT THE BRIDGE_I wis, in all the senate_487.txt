HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
I wis, in all the senate
There was no heart so bold
But sore it ached, and fast it beat,
When that ill news was told.
Forthwith up rose the consul,
Up rose the fathers all ;
In haste they girded up their gowns,
And hied them to the wall.
They held a council, standing
Before the river-gate ;
Short time was there, ye well may guess.
For musing or debate.
Outspake the consul roundly :
" The bridge must straight go down;
For, since Janiculum is lost,
Naught else can save the town."
Just then a scout came flying,
All wild with haste and fear :
"To arms ! to arms ! sir consulLars Porsena is here. "
On the low hills to westward
The consul fixed his eye,
And saw the swarthy storm of dust
Rise fast along the sky.
But the consul's brow was sad,
And the consul's speech was low,
And darkly looked he at the wall,
And darkly at the foe :
"Their van will be upon us Before the bridge goes down;
