TRY AGAIN
"Perhaps the great Tree will forget,
And let us stay until the spring,
If we all beg, andcoax, and fret."
But the great Tree did no such thing;
He smiled to hear their whispering.
"Come, children, all to bed," he cried;
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer,
He shook his head, and far and wide,
Fluttering and rustling everywhere,
Down sped the leaflets through the air.
I saw them; on the ground they lay,
Golden and red, ahuddled swarm,
Waiting till one from far away,
White bedclothes heaped uponher arm,
Should come to wrap them safe and warm.
The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.
"Good-night, dear little leaves," he said.
And from below each sleepy child Replied, "Good-night," and murmured,
"It is so nice to go to bed!"
