TSEVEN TIMES ONE
By Jean Ingelow
HERE'S no dew left on the daisies and clover ;
There's no rain left in heaven;
I've said my"seven times" over and over- Seven times one are seven.
I am old! so old I can write a letter ;
My birthday lessons are done:
The lambs play always, they know no better ;
They are only one times one.
OMoon! in the night I have seen you sailing,
And shining so round and low;
You were bright! ah, bright! but your light is failing;
You are nothing now but abow.
