TO THE LORD GENERAL CROMWELLC
By John Milton
ROMWELL, our chief of men, who through a
cloud
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plowed,
And on the neck of crowned fortune proud Hast reared God's trophies, and his work pur sued,
While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued
And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud,
And Worcester's laureate wreath. Yet much remains
