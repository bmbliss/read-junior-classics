THE ANCIENT MARINER
And now this spell was snapt : once more I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw Of what had else been seenLike one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.
But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made :
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.
It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring- It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.
Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too :
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze- On me alone it blew.
Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed The light-house top Isee ?
Is this the hill ? is this the kirk ?
Is this mine own countree ?
Wedrifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray440
