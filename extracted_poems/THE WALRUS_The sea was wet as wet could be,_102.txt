THE WALRUS
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overheadThere were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"
"If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"Idoubt it," said the Carpenter,
Andshed abitter tear.
"ÎŸ Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"Apleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy headMeaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed.
