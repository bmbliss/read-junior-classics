THE JUMBLIES
By Edward Lear
HEY went to sea in THEY a sieve, they did,
sieve they went to sea:
In spite of all their friends could say,
On awinter's morn, on a stormy day,
In asieve they went to sea.
And when the sieve turned round and round,
Andevery one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"
They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big ;
But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:
In a sieve we'll go to sea!"
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
