OBIN'S in the tree-top,
Blossoms in the grass,
Green things a-growing Everywhere you pass;
Sudden little breezes,
Showers of silver dew,
Black bough and bent twig Budding out anew;
Pine-tree and willow-tree,
Fringèd elm and larchDon't you think that May-time's
Pleasanter than March ?

MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
Apples in the orchard Mellowing one by one;
Strawberries upturning Soft cheeks to the sun;
Roses faint with sweetness,
Lilies fair of face,
Drowsy scents and murmurs Haunting every place ;
Lengths of golden sunshine,
Moonlight bright as day- Don't you think that summer's Pleasanter than May?
Roger in the corn-patch Whistling negro songs ;
Pussy by the hearth-side
Romping with the tongs ;
Chestnuts in the ashes
Bursting through the rind;
Red leaf and gold leaf Rustling down the wind;
Mother "doin' peaches"
All the afternoonDon't you think that autumn's Pleasanter than June?
Little fairy snow-flakes Dancing in the flue ;
Old Mr. Santa Claus,
What is keeping you?
Twilight and firelight Shadows come and go;

WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST?
Merry chime of sleigh-bells Tinkling through the snow;
Mother knitting stockings (Pussy's got the ball) ,—
Don't you think that winter's Pleasanter than all?
WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST?

By L. Maria Child
O- WHIT! to-whit ! to-whee!
Willyou listen tome?
Who stole four eggs I laid,
And the nice nest I made?"
"Not I," said the cow; "Moo-oo!
Such a thing I'd never do.
I gave you a wisp of hay,
But didn't take your nest away.
Not I," said the cow, "Mo0-00!
Such a thing I'd never do."
"To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!

And the nice nest I made?"
"Bob-o'-link! Bob-o'-link!

Who stole a nest away From the plum-tree, to-day?"

But the nest I did not take.

Coo-coo! Coo-coo! Coo-coo!

"Not I," said the sheep; "Oh, no!
Iwouldn't treat a poor bird so.

But the nest was none of mine.
Baa! Baa!" said the sheep; "Oh, no,

"Caw! Caw! " cried the crow ;
" I should like to know
What thief took away Abird's nest to-day ? "
"Cluck! Cluck! " said the hen,
"Don't ask me again.
Why, I haven't a chick Would do such a trick.
We all gave her a feather,
And she wove them together.
I'd scorn to intrude
On her and her brood.
Cluck! Cluck! " said the hen,
" Don't ask me again."
"Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr !
All the birds make a stir !
Let us find out his name,
And all cry 'For shame ! ' "
"I would not rob abird,"
Said Little Mary Green ;
"I think I never heard
Of anything so mean."
