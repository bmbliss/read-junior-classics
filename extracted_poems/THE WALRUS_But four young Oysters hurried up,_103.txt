THE WALRUS
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat :
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat
Andthis was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four ;
Andthick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more- Allhopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so,
Andthen they rested on a rock Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood Andwaited in a row.
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things :
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax- Of cabbages and kings- Andwhy the sea is boiling hot- And whether pigs have wings. "
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat ;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat ! "
"No hurry! " said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
