HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
For all Etruria's noblest
Were round the fatal place.
But all Etruria's noblest
Felt their hearts sink to see
On the earth the bloody corpses,
In the path the dauntless three ;
And from the ghastly entrance,
Where those bold Romans stood,
All shrank-like boys who, unaware,
Ranging a wood to start ahare,
Come to the mouth of the dark lair
Where, growling low, a fierce old bear Lies amidst bones and blood.
Was none who would be foremost
To lead such dire attack;
But those behind cried "Forward!"
And those before cried "Back!"
And backward now, and forward,
Wavers the deep array;
And on the tossing sea of steel
To and fro the standards reel,
And the victorious trumpet-peal
Dies fitfully away.
Yet one man for one moment
Strode out before the crowd;
Well known was he to all the three,
And they gave him greeting loud:
"Now welcome, welcome, Sextus !
Now welcome to thy home!
Why dost thou stay, and turn away?
Here lies the road to Rome."
