THE OLD WOMAN
But the rope would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rat. So
she said-
"Rat, rat, gnaw rope !
Rope won't hang butcher;
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water ;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog ;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the rat would not.
She went a little further, and she met a cat. So
she said-
"Cat, cat, kill rat!
Rat won't gnaw rope;
Rope won't hang butcher;
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water ;
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
The cat said, "If you will give me a saucer of milk, I will kill the rat. "
