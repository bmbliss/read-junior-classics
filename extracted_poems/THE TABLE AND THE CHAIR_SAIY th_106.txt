THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR
SAIY th
By Edward Lear
AID the Table to the Chair,
can hardly be aware репреп
How I suffer from the heat,
And from chilblains on my feet.
If we took a little walk,
We might have a little talk ;
Pray let us take the air, "
Said the Table to the Chair.
Said the Chair unto the Table,
"Now, you know we are not able :
How foolishly you talk,
When you know we cannot walk! "
Said the Table with a sigh,
"It can do no harm to try.
I've as many legs as you :
Why can't we walk on two?"
So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
As they toddled round and round ;
