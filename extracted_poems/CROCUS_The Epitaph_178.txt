CROCUS
The Epitaph
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth Ayouth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere ;
Heavendid a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heaven ( 'twas all he wish'd) a
friend.
No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose, )
The bosom of his Father and his God.
