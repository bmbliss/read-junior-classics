DAYBREAK
In the days of old, when the spring with cold
Had brightened his branches gray,
Through the grass at his feet crept maidens sweet,
To gather the dew of May.
And on that day to the rebeck gay They frolicked with lovesome swains ;
They are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid,
But the tree it still remains.
Then here's, &c.
He saw the rare times when the Christmas chimes
Was amerry sound to hear,
When the squire's wide hall and the cottage small Were filled with good English cheer.
Now gold hath the sway we all obey,
And a ruthless king is he;
But he never shall send our ancient friend
To be tossed on the stormy sea.
Then here's, &c.
