ITAFTER BLENHEIM
By Robert Southey
T was a summer evening ;
Old Kaspar's work was done,
And he before his cottage door
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round Which he beside the rivulet
In playing there had found;
He came to ask what he had found
That was so large and smooth and round.
Old Kaspar took it from the boy,
Who stood expectant by;
And then the old man shook his head,
And with a natural sigh "'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,
"Who fell in the great victory.
