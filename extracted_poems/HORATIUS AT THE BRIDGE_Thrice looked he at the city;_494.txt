HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
Thrice looked he at the city;
Thrice looked he at the dead;
Andthrice came on in fury,
And thrice turned back in dread;
And, white with fear and hatred,
Scowled at the narrow way
Where, wallowing in a pool ofblood,
The bravest Tuscans lay.
But meanwhile axe and lever
Have manfully been plied;
And now the bridge hangs tottering Above the boiling tide.
"Come back, come back, Horatius !"
Loud cried the fathers all-
"Back, Lartius ! back, Herminius !
Back, ere the ruin fall !"
Back darted Spurius LartiusHerminius darted back;
And, as they passed, beneath their feet
They felt the timbers crack.
But when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more;
But with a crash like thunder
Fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck Lay right athwart the stream;
And a long shout of triumph Rose from the walls of Rome,
