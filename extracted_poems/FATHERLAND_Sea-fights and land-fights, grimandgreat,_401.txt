FATHERLAND
Sea-fights and land-fights, grimandgreat,
Fought to make and to save the State :
Weary marches and sinking ships ;
Cheers of victory on dying lips ;
Days of plenty and years of peace;
March of a strong land's swift increase ;
Equal justice, right, and law,
Stately honor and reverend awe;
Sign of a nation, great and strong Toward her people from foreign wrong:
Pride and glory and honor-all Live in the colors to stand or fall.
Hats off!
Along the street there comes
Ablare of bugles, a ruffle of drums ;
And loyal hearts are beating high :
Hats off!
The flag is passing by!
