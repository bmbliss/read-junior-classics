GREEN THINGS GROWING
Look around thee, look around!
Flowers in all the fields abound:
Every running stream is bright ;
All the orchard trees are white;
And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit.
Turn thine eyes to earth and heaven:
God for thee the spring has given,
Taught the birds their melodies,
Clothed the earth and cleared the skies
For thy pleasure or thy food;
Pour thy soul in gratitude.
