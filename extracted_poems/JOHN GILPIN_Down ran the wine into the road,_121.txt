JOHN GILPIN
Down ran the wine into the road,
Most piteous to be seen,
Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
As they had basted been.
But still he seem'd to carry weight,
With leathern girdle braced ;
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington These gambols he did play,
Until he came unto the Wash
Of Edmonton so gay ;
And there he threw the Wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop,
Or awild goose at play.
AtEdmonton his loving wife From the balcony spied Her tender husband, wondering much To see how he did ride.
"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! Here's the house ! "
They all at once did cry ;
"The dinner waits, and we are tired ;"
Said Gilpin, "So am I ! "
But yet his horse was not a whit Inclined to tarry there ;
For why ? his owner had a house Full ten miles off, at Ware.
