HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And if they once may win the bridge,
What hope to save the town?"
Then outspake brave Horatius,
The captain of the gate :
"To every man upon this earth Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds
For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his gods?
"And for the tender mother
Who dandled him to rest,
And for the wife who nurses
His baby at her breast,
And for the holy maidens Who feed the eternal flameTo save them from false Sextus That wrought the deed of shame?
"Hew down the bridge, sir consul,
With all the speed ye may;
I, with two more to help me,
Will hold the foe in play- In yon strait path a thousand May well be stopped by three.
Now who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?"
Then outspake Spurius LartiusARamnian proud was he:
"Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,
And keep the bridge with thee. "
