TTHE GIANT
By Charles Mackay
HERE came a Giant to my door,
AGiant fierce and strong;
His step was heavy on the floor,
His arms were ten yards long.
He scowled and frowned; he shook the
ground;
I trembled through and through;
At length I looked him in the face And cried, "Who cares for you?"

MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
The mighty Giant, as I spoke,
Grewpale and thin and small,
And through his body, as 'twere smoke,
I saw the sunshine fall.
His blood- red eyes turned blue as skies;-
"Is this," I cried, with growing pride,
"Is this the mighty foe?"
:
He sank before my earnest face,
He vanished quite away,
Andleft no shadow inhis place Between me and the day.
Such giants come to strike us dumb,
But, weak in every part,
They melt before the strong man's eyes,
Andfly the true of heart.
