PROCRASTINATION
For a' that, and a' that,
His riband, star, and a' that,
Theman of independent mind,
He looks and laughs at a' that.
Aprince can make a belted knight,
Amarquis, duke, and a' that ;
But an honest man's aboon his might,
Guid faith he maunna fa' that !
For a' that, and a' that,
Their dignities, and a' that,
The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth,
Are higher rank than a' that.
Then let us pray that come it mayAs come it will for a' thatThat sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,
Maybear the gree, and a' that ;
For a' that, and a' that,
It's coming yet for a' that,
That man to man, the warld o'er,
Shall brothers be for a' that!
