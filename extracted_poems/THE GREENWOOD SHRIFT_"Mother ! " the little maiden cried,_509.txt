THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
"Mother ! " the little maiden cried,
Or e'er she reached the woman's side,
And kissed her clay-cold cheek- "I have not idled in the town,
But long went wandering up and down,
The minister to seek.
"They told me here, they told me there- I think they mocked me everywhere ;
And when I found his home,
And begged him on my bended knee To bring his book and come with me,
Mother! he would not come.
" I told him how you dying lay,
And could not go in peace away Without the minister ;
I begged him, for dear Christ his sake,
But O, my heart was fit to breakMother! he would not stir.
"So, though my tears were blinding me,
I ran back, fast as fast could be,
To come again to you ;
And here close by this squire I met,
Who asked (so mild) what made me fret ;
And when I told him true-
"" I will go with you, child, ' he said,
'God sends me to this dying bed'- Mother, he's here, hard by."
While thus the little maiden spoke,
The man, his back against an oak,
Looked on with glistening eye.
