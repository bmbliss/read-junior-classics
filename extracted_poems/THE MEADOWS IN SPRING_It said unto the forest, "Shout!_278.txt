THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
It said unto the forest, "Shout!
Hang all your leafy banners out! "
It touched the wood-bird's folded wing,
And said, "O bird, awake and sing!"
And o'er the farms, "O chanticleer,
Your clarion blow; the day is near!"
It whispered to the fields of corn,
"Bow down, and hail the coming morn! "
It shouted through the belfry-tower,
"Awake, Obell! proclaim the hour."
It crossed the churchyard with a sigh,
Andsaid, "Not yet! in quiet lie."
