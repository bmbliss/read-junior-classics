THE ARAB
Evening shall darken on the earth, and o'er the
sandy plain Some other steed, with slower step, shall bear me
home again.
Yes, thou must go! the wild, free breeze, the bril- liant sun and sky,
Thy master's house-from all of these my exiled one must fly;
Thy proud dark eye will grow less proud, thy step become less fleet,
And vainly shalt thou arch thy neck, thy master's
hand to meet.
Only in sleep shall I behold that dark eye, glancing bright;-
Only in sleep shall hear again that step so firm and light;
And when I raise my dreaming arm to check or cheer thy speed,
Then must I, starting, wake to feel-thou'rt sold,
my Arab steed!
Ah! rudely, then, unseen by me, some cruel hand may chide,
Till foam-wreaths lie, like crested waves, along thy panting side:
And the rich blood that's in thee swells, in thy in- dignant pain,
Till careless eyes, which rest on thee, may count each starting vein.
Will they ill-use thee? If I thought-but no, it cannot be
Thou art so swift, yet easy curbed; so gentle, yet
so free:
