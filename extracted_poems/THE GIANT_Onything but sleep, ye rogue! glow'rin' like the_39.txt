THE GIANT
Onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the
moon,
Rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon,
Rumblin' , tumblin', roun' about, crowin' like a
cock,
Skirlin' like a kenna-what-wauknin' sleepin' folk.
Hey, Willie Winkie! the wean's in a creel!
Waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel,
Ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her
thrumsHey, Willie Winkie!-See, there he comes!
Wearie is the mither that has a storie wean,
Awee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane,
That has a battle aye wi' sleep before he'll close an
ee;
But a kiss frae aff his rosy lips gies strength anew
to me.
