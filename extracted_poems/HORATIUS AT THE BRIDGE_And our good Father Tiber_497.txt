HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And our good Father Tiber
Bare bravely up his chin.
"Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus-
"Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day We should have sacked the town!"
"Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena,
"And bring him safe to shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before."
And now he feels the bottom;
Now on dry earth he stands ;
Now round him throng the fathers
To press his gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the river-gate,
Borne by the joyous crowd.
They gave him of the corn-land,
That was of public right,
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night;
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on highAnd there it stands unto this day To witness if I lie.
It stands in the comitium,
Plain for all folk to see381
