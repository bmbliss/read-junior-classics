LADY CLARE
"They say it was a shocking sight
After the field was won;
For many thousand bodies here
Lay rotting in the sun:
But things like that, you know, must be After a famous victory.
"Great praise the Duke of Marlboro' won
And our good Prince Eugene; "
-"Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!"
Said little Wilhelmine;
"Nay ... nay ... my little girl," quoth he,
"It was a famous victory!
"And everybody praised the Duke Who this great fight did win."
-"But what good came of it at last?"
Quoth little Peterkin:-
"Why, that I can not tell," said he,
"But 'twas a famous victory."
