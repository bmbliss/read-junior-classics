JOHN GILPIN
Whence straight he came, with hat and wig,
Awig that flow'd behind ;
Ahat not much the worse for wear;
Each comely in its kind.
He held them up, and in his turn Thus show'd his ready wit :
"My head is twice as big as yours,
They therefore needs must fit.
"But let me scrape the dirt away,
That hangs upon your face;
And stop and eat, for well you may Be in ahungry case."
Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
And all the world would stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton,
And I should dine at Ware!"
So, turning to his horse, he said,
"I am in haste to dine;
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
You shall goback for mine."
Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!
For which he paid full dear;
For, while he spake, abraying ass Did sing most loud and clear;
Whereat his horse did snort, as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And ' gallop'd off with all his might,
Ashe had done before.
