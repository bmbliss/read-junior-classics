JOHN GILPIN
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
Away went hat and wig;
He little dreamt, when he set out,
Of running such a rig.
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
Like streamer long and gay,
Till loop and button failing both,
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern The bottles he had slung;
Abottle swinging at each side,
Ashath been said or sung.
The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,
Up flew the windows all ;
Andevery soul cried out: "Well done!"
As loud as he could bawl.
Awaywent Gilpin-who but he?
His fame soon spread around,
"He carries weight; he rides a race!
'Tis for a thousand pound! "
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view
How in a trice the turnpike men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now, as he went bowing down His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shatter'd at a blow.
