AMORTIFYING MISTAKE
Heavy are your eyes, my sweet,
Weary are your little feet- Nestle closer up to me
In your pretty cap and gown;
Don't detain
The Shut-Eye train!
"Ting-a-ling! " the bell it goeth,
"Toot-toot ! " the whistle bloweth;
Oh, the sights that we shall see !
All aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
