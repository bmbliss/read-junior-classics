HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And outspake strong Herminius- Of Titian blood was he:
"I will abide on thy left side,
Andkeep the bridge with thee."
The three stood calm and silent,
And looked upon the foes,
Andagreat shout of laughter From all the vanguard rose ;
And forth three chiefs came spurring
Before that deep array;
To earth they sprang, their swords they
drew,
And lifted high their shields, and flew To win the narrow way.
Aunus, from green Tifernum,
Lord of the hill of vines ;
And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves Sicken in Ilva's mines ;
And Picus, long to Clusium Vassal in peace and war,
Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
From that gray crag where, girt with towers,
The fortress of Nequinum lowers O'er the pale waves of Nar.
Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
Into the stream beneath;
Herminius struck at Seius,
And clove him to the teeth ;
At Picus brave Horatius
Darted one fiery thrust
