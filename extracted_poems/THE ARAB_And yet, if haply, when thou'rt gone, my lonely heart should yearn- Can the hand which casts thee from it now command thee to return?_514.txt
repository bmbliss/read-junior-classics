THE ARAB
And yet, if haply, when thou'rt gone, my lonely heart should yearn- Can the hand which casts thee from it now command thee to return?
Return! alas! myArab steed! what shall thy master do,
When thou, who wast his all of joy, hast vanished
from his view?
When the dim distance cheats mine eye, and through the gathering tears
Thy bright form, for a moment, like the false
mirage appears ;
alone,
Slow and unmounted shall I roam, with weary step
Where, with fleet step and joyous bound, thou oft hast borne me on;
And sitting down by that green well, I'll pause and sadly think,
"It was here he bowed his glossy neck when last I
saw him drink!"
When last I saw thee drink-Away ! ! the fevered dream is o'erI could not live aday, and know that we should meet no more!
They tempted me, my beautiful ! for hunger's power is strongThey tempted me, my beautiful! but I have loved too long.
Who said that I had given thee up? who said that thou wast sold?
'Tis false 'tis false, my Arab steed! I fling them back their gold!
