THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Anything like the sound of a rat
Makes myheart go pit-a-pat !"
"Come in!" the Mayor cried, looking bigger,
And in did come the strangest figure!
His queer long coat, from heel to head Was half of yellow and half of red,
And he himself was tall and thin,
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,
And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,
But lips where smiles went out and in;
There was no guessing his kith and kin:
Andnobody could enough admire The tall man and his quaint attire.
Quoth one: "It's as if my great-grandsire,
Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,
Had walked this way from his painted tomb- stone!"
He advanced to the council table:
And, "Please your honors," said he, "I'm
able,
Bymeans of a secret charm, to draw All creatures living beneath the sun,
That creep, or swim, or fly, or run,
After me so as you never saw!
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm,
The mole, the toad, the newt, the viper;
And people call me the Pied Piper. "
(And here they noticed round his neck
Ascarf of red and yellow stripe 149
