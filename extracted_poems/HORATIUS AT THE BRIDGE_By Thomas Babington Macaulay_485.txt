HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
By Thomas Babington Macaulay
LARSPORSENAOfClusium,
By the nine gods he swore That the great house of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.
By the nine gods he swore it,
Andnamed a trysting-day,
Andbade his messengers ride forth,
East and west and south and north,
To summon his array.
East and west and south and north
The messengers ride fast,
And tower and town and cottage
Have heard the trumpet's blast.
Shame on the false Etruscan
Who lingers in his home,
When Porsena of Clusium
Is on the march for Rome!
There be thirty chosen prophets,
The wisest of the land,
Who always by Lars Porsena
Both morn and evening stand.
