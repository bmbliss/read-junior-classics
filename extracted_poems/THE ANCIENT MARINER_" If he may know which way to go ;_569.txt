THE ANCIENT MARINER
" If he may know which way to go ;
For she guides him smooth or grim.
See, brother, see ! how graciously She looketh down on him."
First Voice
"But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without or wave or wind ? "
Second Voice
"The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind.
" Fly, brother, fly ! more high, more high !
Or we shall be belated :
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated. "
I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather :
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high,
The dead men stood together.
All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter :
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.
The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away :
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.
