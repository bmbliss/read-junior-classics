THE DESERTED VILLAGE
To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
One native charm, than all the gloss of art.
Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play,
The soul adopts, and owns their firstborn sway;
Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,
Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined :
But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,
With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd- In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,
The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
And, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,
The heart, distrusting, asks if this be joy?
Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,
'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand
Between a splendid and ahappy land.
Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted
ore,
And shouting Folly hails them from her shore ;
Hoards, e'en beyond the miser's wish, abound,
And rich men flock from all the world around.
Yet, count our gains. This wealth is but aname That leaves our useful products still the same.
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds ;
Space for his horses, equipage and hounds :
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,
Has robb'd the neighboring fields of half their growth;
His seat, where solitary sports are seen,
Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;
