AFTER BLENHEIM
"I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;
And often when I go to plow The plowshare turns them out.
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory."
"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"
Young Peterkin he cries ;
And little Wilhelmine looks up With wonder-waiting eyes ;
"Now tell us all about the war,
Andwhat they fought each other for?"
"It was the English," Kaspar cried,
"Who put the French to rout;
But what they fought each other for I could not well make out.
But everybody said," quoth he,
"That 'twas a famous victory.
"My father lived at Blenheim then,
Yon little stream hard by ;
They burned his dwelling to the ground,
Andhe was forced to fly:
So with his wife and child he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.
"With fire and sword the country round Was wasted far and wide,
And many a childing mother then And new-born baby died:
But things like that, you know, must be At every famous victory.
