THE SLEEPY SONGAS
Shewent to the seamstress
To buy him some linen,
Butwhen she came back
The dog was spinning.
She went to the hosier's
To buy him some hose,
But when she came back
Hewas dress'd in his clothes.
Thedame made a curtsey,
Thedogmade abow;
The dame said, "Your servant,"
The dog said, "Bow, wow."
