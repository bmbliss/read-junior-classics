NASEBY
Fast, fast the gallants ride, in some safe nook to
hide
Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar;
And he he turns ! he flies ! shame on those cruel
eyes
That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on
war!
Ho, comrades! scour the plain; and ere ye strip the
slain,
First give another stab to make your search secure;
Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad- pieces and lockets,
The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor.
Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold,
When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans
to-day;
And to-morrow shall the fox from her chambers in
the rocks
Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey.
Where be your tongues, that late mocked at heaven and hell and fate?
And the fingers that once were so busy with your
blades?
Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths?
Your stage-plays andyour sonnets, your diamonds and your spades ?
