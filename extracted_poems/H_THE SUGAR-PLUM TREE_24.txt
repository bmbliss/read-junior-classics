H
THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE
AVE you
Tree?
By Eugene Field
ever heard of the Sugar-Plum
'Tis a marvel of great renown!
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea,
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet (As those who have tasted it say)
That good little children have only to eat Of that fruit to be happy next day.
When you've got to the tree, you would have a
hard time
To capture the fruit which I sing;
The tree is so tall that no person could climb
To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,
And agingerbread dog prowls below- And this is the way you contrive to get at Those sugar-plums tempting you so:

YOUNG NIGHT- THOUGHT

You say but the word to that gingerbread dog And he barks with such terrible zest
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,
As her swelling proportions attest.
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
From this leafy limb unto that,
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground- Hurrah for that chocolate cat !
There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and pepper- mint canes,
With stripings of scarlet or gold,
And you carry away of the treasure that rains As much as your apron can hold !
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me
In your dainty white nightcap and gown,
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.
YOUNG NIGHT- THOUGHT
By Robert Louis Stevenson
LL night long and every night, AWhenmy mamma puts out the light,
Isee the people marching by,
Asplain as day, before my eye.
Armies and emperors and kings,
All carrying different kinds of things,
Andmarching in so grand away,
You never saw the like by day.
