LOSSOM on the plum,
Wild wind and merry;
Leaves upon the cherry,
And one swallow come.
Red windy dawn,
Swift rain and sunny;
Wild bees seeking honey,
Crocus on the lawn;
Blossom on the plum.


Grass begins to grow
Dandelions come ;
Snowdrops haste to go
After last month's snow;
Rough winds beat and blow,
Blossom on the plum.
SUCCESSION OF THE FOUR
SWEET MONTHS
