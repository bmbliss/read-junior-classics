ETWEEN the dark and the daylight, When night is beginning to lower, Comes a pause in the day's occupations, That is known as the children's hour. I hear in the chamber above me The patter of little feet, The sound of a door that is opened, And voices soft and sweet. THE CHILDREN'S HOUR From my study I see in the lamplight, Descending the broad hall stair, Grave Alice and laughing Allegra, And Edith with golden hair. Awhisper and then a silence, Yet I know by their merry eyes They are plotting and planning together To take me by surprise. Asudden rush from the stairway, Asudden raid from the hall, By three doors left unguarded, They enter my castle wall. They climb up into my turret, O'er the arms and back of my chair; If I try to escape, they surround me: They seem to be everywhere. They almost devour me with kisses, Their arms about me intwine, Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen In his Mouse- Tower on the Rhine. Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, Because you have scaled the wall, Such an old mustache as I am Is not a match for you all? I have you fast in my fortress, Andwill not let you depart, But put you into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart. SMALL AND EARLY And there will I keep you forever, Yes, forever and aday, Till the walls shall crumble to ruin, Andmoulder in dust away.
