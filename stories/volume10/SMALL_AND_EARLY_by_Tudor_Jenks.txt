HEN Dorothy and I took tea, we sat upon
the floor;
No matter how much tea I drank, she always gave
me more;
Our table was the scarlet box in which her teaset came;
Our guests, an armless one-eyed doll, a wooden
horse gone lame.
She poured out nothing, very fast-the tea pot tipped on high- And in the bowl found sugar lumps unseen by my
dull eye.

She added rich ( pretended) cream-it seemed a
wilful waste,
For though she overflowed the cup, it did not change the taste.
She asked, " Take milk?" or "Sugar?" and though I answered "No, "
She put them in, and told me that I "must take it so!"
She'd say "Another cup, Papa?" and I, "No, thank you, Ma'am, "
But then I had to take it-her courtesy was sham.


Still, being neither green, nor black, nor English breakfast tea,
It did not give her guests the "nerves"-whatever those may be.
Though often I upset my cup, she only minded when
I would mistake the empty cups for those she'd filled again.
She tasted my cup gingerly, for fear I'd burn my
tongue;
Indeed, she really hurt my pride-she made me feel so young.
I must have drunk some two-score cups, and Dorothy sixteen,
Allowing only needful time to pour them in between.
Westirred with massive pewter spoons, and sipped
in courtly ease,
With all the ceremony of the stately Japanese.
At length she put the cups away, "Good-night,
Papa," she said;
And I went to a real tea, and Dorothy to bed.

HERE was pretty chicken, once a
But his friends were very few,
For he thought that there was nothing In the world but what he knew.
So he always in the farmyard Had a very forward way,

Telling all the hens and turkeys What they ought to do and say. "Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder That your goslings you should let
Go out paddling in the water
;
It will kill them to get wet.
"
"And
I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,"
Hebegan to her one day
,
"That you wouldn't sit all summer
In your nest uponthe hay
;
Won't you come out to the meadow,
Where the grass with seeds is filled?" "If I should," said Mrs. Dorking, " Then my eggs would get all chilled." "No, they won't," replied the chicken; "And no matter if they do.
Eggs are really good for nothing.
What's an egg to me or you
?"
"What's an egg?" said Mrs. Dorking
.
Andif kind wings had not warmed you, "Can it be you do not know?
You yourself were in an eggshell Just a little month agoYou would not be out to-day,
Telling hens
, and geese, and turkeys
What they ought to do or say
!
"
To be very wise and show it,
Is
apleasant thing
, no doubt
;
Butwhenyoung folks talk to old folks,
They should know what they're about
.

ROM Oberon, in fairy land,
The king of ghosts and shadows there,
Mad Robin I, at his command,
Amsent to view the night-sports here.
What revel rout
Is kept about,
In every corner where I go,
I will o'ersee,
And merry be,
Andmake good sport, with ho, ho, ho!
More swift than lightning can I fly About this airy welkin soon,
And, in aminute's space, descry Each thing that's done below the moon.
There's not a hag
Or ghost shall wag,
Or cry 'ware goblins ! where I go;
But, Robin, I
Their feats will spy,
And send them home with ho, ho, ho!
Whene'er such wanderers I meet,
As from their night-sports they trudge home,
With counterfeiting voice I greet,
And call them on with me to roam;
Through woods, through lakes,
Through bogs, through brakes,


Or else, unseen, with them I go,
All in the nick
To play some trick,
And frolic it, with ho, ho, ho!
Sometimes I meet them like a man,
Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound;
And to a horse I turn me can,
To trip and trot about them round.
But if to ride,
My back they stride,
More swift than wind away I go,
O'er hedge and lands,
Through pools and ponds,
