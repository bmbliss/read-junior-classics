Enter TITANIA, with her train TITANIA. Come, now a roundel, and afairy Then, for the third part of aminute, hence;- Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds; Some, war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, To make my small elves coats; and some, keep back The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep ; Then to your offices, and let me rest. SONG 1 FAIRY. You spotted snakes, with double tongue, Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen; Nerets, and blind-worms, do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen. CHORUS Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby; Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby : Never harm, Nor spell nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby. YELLOW SANDS 1 FAIRY. Weaving spiders, come not here; Hence, you long-legged spinners hence! Beetles black, approach not near; Worm, nor snail, do no offence. CHORUS Philomel, with melody, Sing in our sweet lullaby; Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby : Never harm, Nor spell nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh; So, good night, with lullaby. 2 FAIRY. Hence, away! now all is well. One aloof stand sentinel! -From "A Midsummer- Night's Dream. "
