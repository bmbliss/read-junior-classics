USH! the waves are rolling in, White with foam, white with foam; Father toils amid the din ; But baby sleeps at home. Hush! the winds roar hoarse and deepOnthey come, on they come ! Brother seeks the wandering sheep; But baby sleeps at home. Hush! the rain sweeps o'er the knowes, Where they roam, where they roam; Sister goes to seek the cows ; But baby sleeps at home.
