HUN delays, they breed remorse;
Take thy time while time is lent thee;
Creeping snails have weakest force;
Fly thy fault, lest thou repent thee;
Good is best when soonest wrought,
Lingering labors come to naught.

CARDINAL WOLSEY'S SPEECH
Hoist up sail while gale doth last ;
Tide and wind wait no man's pleasure;
Seek not time when time is past;
Sober speed is wisdom's leisure ;
Afterwits are dearly bought,
Let thy forewit guide thy thought.
CARDINAL WOLSEY SPEECH TO
CROMWELL
