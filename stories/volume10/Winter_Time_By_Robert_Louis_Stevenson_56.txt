ATE lies the wintry sun a-bed, Afrosty, fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two; and then, Ablood-red orange, sets again. Before the stars have left the skies, Atmorning in the dark I rise; And, shivering in my nakedness, Bythe cold candle, bathe anddress. Closeby the jolly fire Isit To warm my frozen bones a bit ; Or, with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door. FOREIGN LANDS When, to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap, The cold wind burns my face, and blows Its frosty pepper up my nose. Black are my steps on silver sod; Thick blows my frosty breath abroad; And tree and house, and hill and lake, Are frosted like a wedding-cake.
