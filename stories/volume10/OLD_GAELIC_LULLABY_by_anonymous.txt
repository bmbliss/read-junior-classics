HUSH! the waves are rolling in,
White with foam, white with foam;
Father toils amid the din ;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the winds roar hoarse and deepOnthey come, on they come !
Brother seeks the wandering sheep;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the rain sweeps o'er the knowes,
Where they roam, where they roam;
Sister goes to seek the cows ;
But baby sleeps at home.
