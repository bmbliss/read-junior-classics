So far and fast to-day;
ran
The birds are weary, for who sang
So many songs as they?
The bees and butterflies at last
Are tired out, for just think, too,
Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through,
And so, as all tired people do,
They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds.
The sun has shut his golden eye
And gone to sleep beneath the sky,
The birds and butterflies and bees
Have all crept into flowers and trees,
And all lie quiet, still as mice,
Till morning comes-like father's voice.
So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you


Must sleep away till morning, too.
Close little eyes, down little heads,
And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.

USH! the waves are rolling in,
White with foam, white with foam;
Father toils amid the din ;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the winds roar hoarse and deepOnthey come, on they come !
Brother seeks the wandering sheep;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the rain sweeps o'er the knowes,
Where they roam, where they roam;
Sister goes to seek the cows ;
But baby sleeps at home.

SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!

LEEP, baby, sleep !
Thy father watches his sheep ;
Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree,
Anddown comes a little dream on thee.
Sleep, baby, sleep!


Sleep, baby, sleep !
The large stars are the sheep ;
The little stars are the lambs, I guess ;
And the gentle moon is the shepherdess.
Sleep, baby, sleep !
Sleep, baby, sleep!
Our Saviour loves His sheep ;
He is the Lamb of God on high,
Who for our sakes came down to die.
Sleep, baby, sleep!
