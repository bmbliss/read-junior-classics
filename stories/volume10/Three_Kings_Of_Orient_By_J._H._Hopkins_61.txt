E three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we traverse far Field and fountain, moor and mountain, Following yonder Star. Born a babe on Bethlehem plain, Gold we bring to crown him again; King for ever, ceasing never, Over us all to reign. Frankincense to offer have I; Incense owns a Deity nigh, Prayer and praising all men raising, Worship Him, God on high. MY BED IS A BOAT Oh, star of wonder, star of might, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to the perfect light.
