"Caw! Caw! " cried the crow ;
" I should like to know
What thief took away Abird's nest to-day ? "
"Cluck! Cluck! " said the hen,
"Don't ask me again.
Why, I haven't a chick Would do such a trick.
We all gave her a feather,
And she wove them together.
I'd scorn to intrude
On her and her brood.
Cluck! Cluck! " said the hen,
" Don't ask me again."
"Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr !
All the birds make a stir !
Let us find out his name,
And all cry 'For shame ! ' "
"I would not rob abird,"
Said Little Mary Green ;
"I think I never heard
Of anything so mean."
THE LEAVES CAME DOWN
"It is very cruel, too,"
Said little Alice Neal;
"I wonder if he knew
How sad the bird would feel?"
Alittle boy hung down his head,
And went and hid behind the bed;
For he stole that pretty nest From poor little yellow-breast;
Andhe felt so full of shame,
He didn't like to tell his name.
