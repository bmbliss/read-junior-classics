HE gingham dog and the calico cat Side by side on the table sat;
'Twas half-past twelve, and (what do you think! )
Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!
The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate Appeared to know as sure as fate There was going to be a terrible spat.
( I wasn't there; Isimply state
What was told me by the Chinese plate! )
The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"
Andthecalico cat replied "Mee-ow! "
The air was littered, an hour or so,
With bits of gingham and calico,
While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place
Up with its hands before its face,
For it always dreaded a family row!
(Now mind: I'm only telling you What the old Dutch clock declares is true!)
LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE
The Chinese plate looked very blue,
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do?"
But the gingham dog and the calico cat
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
Employing every tooth and claw In the awfullest way you ever saw- And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
(Don't fancy I exaggerate!
Igot my news from the Chinese plate! )
Next morning, where the two had sat,
They found no trace of dog or cat ;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away!
But the truth about the cat and pup Is this : they ate each other up!
Nowwhat do you really think of that!
( The old Dutch clock it told me so,
And that is how I came to know. )
