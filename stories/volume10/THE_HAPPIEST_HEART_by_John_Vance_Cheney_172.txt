WHOdrives the horses of the sun
lord it but a day;
Better the lowly deed were done,
And kept the humble way.
The rust will find the sword of fame,
The dust will hide the crown;

Time will not tear it down.
INSIGNIFICANT EXISTENCE
The happiest heart that ever beat Was in some quiet breast That found the common daylight sweet,
And left to Heaven the rest.
