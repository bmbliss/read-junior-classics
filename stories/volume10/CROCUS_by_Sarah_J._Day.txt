THE Crocus had slept in his little round house
So soundly the whole winter through;
There came a tap-tapping-'twas spring at the door:
"Up! up ! we are waiting for you!"
The Crocus peeped out from his little brown house
And nodded his gay little head;
"Good-morning, Miss Snowdrop! and how do you
do
This fine, chilly morning?" he said.
