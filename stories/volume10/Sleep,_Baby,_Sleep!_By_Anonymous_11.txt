LEEP, baby, sleep !
Thy father watches his sheep ;
Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree,
Anddown comes a little dream on thee.
Sleep, baby, sleep!
LADY BUTTON-EYES
Sleep, baby, sleep !
The large stars are the sheep ;
The little stars are the lambs, I guess ;
And the gentle moon is the shepherdess.
Sleep, baby, sleep !
Sleep, baby, sleep!
Our Saviour loves His sheep ;
He is the Lamb of God on high,
Who for our sakes came down to die.
Sleep, baby, sleep!
