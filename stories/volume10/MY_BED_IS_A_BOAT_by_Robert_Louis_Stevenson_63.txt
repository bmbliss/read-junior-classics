Ybed is like a little boat;
Nurse helps me in when I embark;
She girds me in my sailor's coat And starts me in the dark.
THE WALRUS
At night, I go onboard and say
Good-night to all my friends on shore;
I shut my eyes and sail away,
And see and hear no more.
And sometimes things to bed I take,
As prudent sailors have to do;
Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
Perhaps a toy or two.
All night across the dark we steer ;
But when the day returns at last,
Safe in my room, beside the pier,
I find my vessel fast.
