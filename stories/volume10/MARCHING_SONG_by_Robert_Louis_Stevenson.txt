WINTER- TIME
Jun. Cl-10
Mary Jane commands the party,
Peter leads the rear ;
Feet in time, alert and hearty,
Each a Grenadier !
All in the most martial manner
Marching double-quick ;
While the napkin like abanner
Waves upon the stick!

Great commander Jane!
Nowthat we've been round the village,
Let's go home again.
