EE WILLIE WINKIE rins through WEELWIL
Up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown,
Tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock,
"Are the weans in their bed?-for it's now ten
o'clock. "
Hey, Willie Winkie! are ye comin' ben?
The cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin'
hen,
The doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a
cheep;
But here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa'
asleep.

THE GIANT
Onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the
moon,
Rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon,
Rumblin' , tumblin', roun' about, crowin' like a
cock,
Skirlin' like a kenna-what-wauknin' sleepin' folk.
Hey, Willie Winkie! the wean's in a creel!
Waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel,
Ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her
thrumsHey, Willie Winkie!-See, there he comes!
Wearie is the mither that has a storie wean,
Awee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane,
That has a battle aye wi' sleep before he'll close an
ee;
But a kiss frae aff his rosy lips gies strength anew
to me.
