HE Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,
Andwhispered, "Now I shall be out of sight ;
So through the valley and over the height,
In silence I'll take my way:
I will not go on with that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,
But I'll be as busy as they."
Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its
crest;
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed In diamond beads-and over the breast
Of the quivering lake he spread
Acoat of mail, that it need not fear
The downward point of many a spear
That hung on its margin far andnear,
Where a rock could rear its head.
ALMOND BLOSSOM
Hewent to the windows of those who slept,
And over each pane, like a fairy, crept ;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he slept,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things-there were flowers and
trees;
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees ;
There were cities with temples and towers, and these
All pictured in silver sheen!
But he did one thing that was hardly fair;
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
That all had forgotten for him to prepare-
"Nowjust to set them a-thinking,
I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,
"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,
And the glass of water they've left for me Shall ' tchich! to tell them I'm drinking."
