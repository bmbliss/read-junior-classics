IRST came the primrose,
On the bank high,
Like a maiden looking forth From the window of a tower
When the battle rolls below,
So looked she,
And saw the storms go by.
Then came the wind-flower
In the valley left behind,
As awounded maiden pale With purple streaks of woe
When the battle has roll'd by Wanders to and fro,
So tottered she,
Dishevell'd in the wind.
Then came the daisies,
On the first of May,
Like a bannered show's advance
While the crowd runs by the way,
With ten thousand flowers about them
They came trooping through the fields.
As a happy people come,
So came they ;
As a happy people come When the war has rolled away,
With dance and tabor, pipe and drum,
And all make holiday.

THE TIGER
Then came the cowslip Like a dancer in the fair,
She spread her little mat of green,
And on it danced she.
With a fillet bound about her brow,
Afillet round her happy brow,
Agolden fillet round her brow,
And rubies in her hair.
