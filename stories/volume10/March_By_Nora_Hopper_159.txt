LOSSOM on the plum, Wild wind and merry; Leaves upon the cherry, And one swallow come. Red windy dawn, Swift rain and sunny; Wild bees seeking honey, Crocus on the lawn; Blossom on the plum. MARCH Grass begins to grow Dandelions come ; Snowdrops haste to go After last month's snow; Rough winds beat and blow, Blossom on the plum.
