SEE, the prettyplanet! Floating sphere !
Faintest breeze will fan it
Far or near;
World as light as feather;
Moonshine rays,
Rainbow tints together,
As it plays ;
:

BABY BYE
Drooping, sinking, failing,
Nigh to earth,
Mounting, whirling, sailing,
Full of mirth ;
Life there, welling, flowing,
Waving round ;
Pictures coming, going,
Without sound.
Quick now, be this airy
Globe repell'd!
Never can the fairy Star be held.
Touch'd-it in a twinkle
Disappears!
Leaving but a sprinkle,
As of tears.
