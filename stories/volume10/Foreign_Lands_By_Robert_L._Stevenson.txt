Pinto the cherry tree,
Who should climb but little me?
Iheld the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad onforeign lands.
I saw the next-door garden lie,
Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before.
I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky's blue looking-glass ;
The dusty roads go up and down
With people tramping in to town.
If I could find ahigher tree,
Further and further I should see,
To where the grown-up river slips Into the sea among the ships ;
THE OWL AND THE PUSSY- CAT
To where the roads on either hand
Lead onward into fairy land,
Where all the children dine at five,
Andall the playthings come alive.
