But not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done,
The frighten'd steed he frighten'd more,
And made him faster run.
Away went Gilpin, and away Went postboy at his heels,
The postboy's horse right glad to miss
The lumbering of the wheels.
Six gentlemen upon the road Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With postboy scampering in the rear They raised the hue and cry:-

THE FLOWERS
"Stop thief !-stop thief !-a highwayman! "
Not one of them was mute ;
Andall and each that pass'd that way Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gates again Flew open in short space:
The toll-men thinking as before That Gilpin rode a race.
And so he did, and won it too!
Forhe got first to town;
Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
Hedid again get down.
-Now let us sing, Long live the King,
And Gilpin, long live he;
And, when he next doth ride abroad,
May I be there to see!
