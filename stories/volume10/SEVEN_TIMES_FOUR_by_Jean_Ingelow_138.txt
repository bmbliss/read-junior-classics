EIGH-HO! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tall!
Whenthe wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses,
Anddance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small!
Here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own
lasses,
Eager to gather them all.
TO A SKYLARK
Heigh-ho ! Daisies and buttercups !
Mother shall thread them a daisy chain;
Sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow,
That loved her brown little ones, loved them full
fair;
Sing, "Heart thou art wide, though the house be but narrow,"
Sing once, and sing it again.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow;
Aship sails afar over warm ocean waters,
Andhaply one musing doth stand at her prow.
Obonny brown sons, and O sweet little daughters,
Maybe he thinks on you now.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tallAsunshiny world full of laughter and leisure,
And fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall !
Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its
measure,
God that is over us all !
TO A SKYLARK
By Percy Bysshe Shelley
HAILBirdto theenever , blithe spirit !
That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
TO A SKYLARK
Higher still and higher From the earth thou springest:
Like a cloud of fire,
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,
Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight,
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delightKeen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere
Whose intense lamp narrows In the white dawn clear,
Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.
All the earth and air
With they voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd.
TO A SKYLARK
What thou art we know not ;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see As from thy presence showers arain of melody:-
Like a poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like ahigh-born maiden
In a palace tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love which overflows her
bower:
Like a glow-worm golden In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aërial hue
Among the flowers and grass which screen it from
the view:
Like a rose embowered
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives Makes faint with too much sweet these heavywingèd thieves.
TO A SKYLARK
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was,
Joyous and clear and fresh-thy music doth
surpass.
Teach us, sprite or bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine :
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus hymeneal
Or triumphal chaunt,
Match'd with thine, would be all
But an empty vauntA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden
want.
What objects are the fountains Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of
pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
TO A SKYLARK
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet, if we could scorn,
Hate and pride, and fear;
If we were things born Not to shed a tear,
Iknow not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Ofdelightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know;
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow The world should listen then as I am listening now
