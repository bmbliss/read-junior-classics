HEIGH-HO! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tall!
Whenthe wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses,
Anddance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small!
Here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own
lasses,
Eager to gather them all.

Heigh-ho ! Daisies and buttercups !
Mother shall thread them a daisy chain;
Sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow,
That loved her brown little ones, loved them full
fair;
Sing, "Heart thou art wide, though the house be but narrow,"
Sing once, and sing it again.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow;
Aship sails afar over warm ocean waters,
Andhaply one musing doth stand at her prow.
Obonny brown sons, and O sweet little daughters,
Maybe he thinks on you now.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tallAsunshiny world full of laughter and leisure,
And fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall !
Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its
measure,
God that is over us all !
