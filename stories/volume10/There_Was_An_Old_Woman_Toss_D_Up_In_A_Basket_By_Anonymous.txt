THERE was an old woman toss'd up in a basket Nineteen times as high as the moon ; Where she was going I couldn't but ask it, For in her hand she carried a broom. "Old woman, old woman, old woman, " quoth I, "O whither, O whither, O whither, so high?" "To brush the cobwebs off the sky !" "Shall I go with thee?" "Ay, by- and-by."
