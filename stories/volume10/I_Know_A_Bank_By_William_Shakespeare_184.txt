a bank where the wild thyme Where oxlips, and the nodding violet grows ; Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine : There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight ; And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. -From "A Midsummer- Night's Dream.
