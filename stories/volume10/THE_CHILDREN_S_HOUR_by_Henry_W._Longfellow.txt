ETWEEN the dark and the daylight,
When night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
That is known as the children's hour.
I hear in the chamber above me
The patter of little feet,
The sound of a door that is opened,
And voices soft and sweet.

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
From my study I see in the lamplight,
Descending the broad hall stair,
Grave Alice and laughing Allegra,
And Edith with golden hair.
Awhisper and then a silence,
Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
To take me by surprise.
Asudden rush from the stairway,
