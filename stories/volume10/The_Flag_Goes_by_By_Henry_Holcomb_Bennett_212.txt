ATS off ! Along the street there comes Ablare of bugles, aruffle of drums, Aflash of color beneath the sky: Hats off! The flag is passing by! Blue and crimson and white it shines Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines. Hats off! The colors before us fly ; But more than the flag is passing by. FATHERLAND Sea-fights and land-fights, grimandgreat, Fought to make and to save the State : Weary marches and sinking ships ; Cheers of victory on dying lips ; Days of plenty and years of peace; March of a strong land's swift increase ; Equal justice, right, and law, Stately honor and reverend awe; Sign of a nation, great and strong Toward her people from foreign wrong: Pride and glory and honor-all Live in the colors to stand or fall. Hats off! Along the street there comes Ablare of bugles, a ruffle of drums ; And loyal hearts are beating high : Hats off! The flag is passing by!
