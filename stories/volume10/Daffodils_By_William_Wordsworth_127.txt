WANDERED lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales andhills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils, Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering anddancing in the breeze. DAFFODIL Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way, They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. The waves beside them danced; but they Outdid the sparkling waves in glee: Apoet could not but be gay In such a jocund company. Igazed, and gazed, but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought. For oft, when on my couch I lie Invacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And thenmyheart with pleasure fills, Anddances with the daffodils.
