OBIN'S in the tree-top,
Blossoms in the grass,
Green things a-growing Everywhere you pass;
Sudden little breezes,
Showers of silver dew,
Black bough and bent twig Budding out anew;
Pine-tree and willow-tree,
Fringèd elm and larchDon't you think that May-time's
Pleasanter than March ?

MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
Apples in the orchard Mellowing one by one;
Strawberries upturning Soft cheeks to the sun;
Roses faint with sweetness,
Lilies fair of face,
Drowsy scents and murmurs Haunting every place ;
Lengths of golden sunshine,
Moonlight bright as day- Don't you think that summer's Pleasanter than May?
Roger in the corn-patch Whistling negro songs ;
Pussy by the hearth-side
Romping with the tongs ;
Chestnuts in the ashes
Bursting through the rind;
Red leaf and gold leaf Rustling down the wind;
Mother "doin' peaches"
All the afternoonDon't you think that autumn's Pleasanter than June?
Little fairy snow-flakes Dancing in the flue ;
Old Mr. Santa Claus,
What is keeping you?
Twilight and firelight Shadows come and go;

WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST?
Merry chime of sleigh-bells Tinkling through the snow;
Mother knitting stockings (Pussy's got the ball) ,—
Don't you think that winter's Pleasanter than all?
WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S NEST?
Jun. Cl-10
