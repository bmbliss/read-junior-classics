WHEN I was a bachelor I lived by myself, And all the meat I got I put upon a shelf ; The rats and the mice did lead me such a life That I went to London to get myself a wife. The streets were so broad and the lanes were sonarrow, I could not get my wife home without a wheelbarrow ; The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall, Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife, and all.
