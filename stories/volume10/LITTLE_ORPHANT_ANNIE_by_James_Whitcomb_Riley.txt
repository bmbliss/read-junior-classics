ITTLE Orphant Annie's come to our house
â˜‘ to stay,
An' wash the cups and saucers up, an' brush the crumbs away,
An' shoo the chickens off the porch, an' dust the hearth, an' sweep,
An' make the fire, an' bake the bread, an' earn her board-an' -keep ;


An' all us other children, when the supper things
is done,
We set around the kitchen fire an' has the mostest
fun
A-list'nin' to the witch-tales 'at Annie tells about,
An' the Gobble-uns 'at gits you Ef you
Don't
Watch
Out!
Onc't they was a little boy wouldn't say his pray'rsAn' when he went to bed at night, away up-stairs,
His mammy heerd him holler, an' his daddy heerd him bawl,
An' when they turn't the kivvers down, he wasn't
there at all!
An' they seeked him in the rafter-room, an' cubby- hole, an' press,
An' seeked him up the chimbly flue, an' ever'- wheres, I guess ;
But all they ever found was thist his pants an'
roundabout!
An' the Gobble-uns'll git you
Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
An one time a little girl 'ud allus laugh an'
An' make fun of ever' one, an' all her blood- grin,
an'-kin,


An' onc't when they was "company," an' old folks
was there,
She mocked 'em an' shocked 'em, an' said she
didn't care!
An' thist as she kicked her heels, an' turn't to run
an' hide,
They was two great big Black Things a-standin'
byher side,
An' they snatched her through the ceilin' 'fore she knowed what she's about!
An' the Gobble-uns'll git you Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
An' little Orphant Annie says, when the blaze is blue,
An' the lampwick sputters, an' the wind goes woo-oo !
An' youhearthe crickets quit, an' the moon is gray,
An' the lightnin' -bugs indewis all squenched away- You better mindyer parents, an' yer teachers fond an' dear,
An' churish them 'at loves you, an' dry the or- phant's tear,
An' he'p the pore an' needy ones 'at clusters all about,
Er the Gobble-uns'll git you
Efyou
Don't
Watch
Out!
