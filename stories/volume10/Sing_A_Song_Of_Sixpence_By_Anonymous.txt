SING a song of sixpence,
A bag full of rye;
Four and twenty blackbirds Baked in a pie ;
When the pie was open'd,
The birds began to sing ;
Was not that a dainty dish
To set before the king?
The king was in his counting-house,
Counting out his money;
The queen was in the parlor,
Eating bread and honey ;
The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,
There came a little blackbird,
And snapped off her nose.
