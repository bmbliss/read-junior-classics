SING a song of sixpence, A bag full of rye; Four and twenty blackbirds Baked in a pie ; When the pie was open'd, The birds began to sing ; Was not that a dainty dish To set before the king? The king was in his counting-house, Counting out his money; The queen was in the parlor, Eating bread and honey ; The maid was in the garden, Hanging out the clothes, There came a little blackbird, And snapped off her nose.
