LOW, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou are not so unkind
As man's ingratitude ;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou are not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.


Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot ;
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember'd not.
