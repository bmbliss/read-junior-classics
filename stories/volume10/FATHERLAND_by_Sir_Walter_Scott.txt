REATHES there the man, with soul
dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned
From wandering on aforeign strand?
If such there breathe, go mark him well:



Forhim nominstrel raptures swell ;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim ;
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.

AMERICAN SOLDIERS
