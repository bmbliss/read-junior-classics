YOUNGDandelion On ahedge-side,
Said young Dandelion,
"Who'll be mybride?
"I'm abold fellow
As ever was seen,
With my shield of yellow,
In the grass creen.
YOUNG DANDELION
"You may uproot me
From field and from lane,
Trample me, cut meI spring up again.
"I never flinch, sir,
Wherever I dwell ;
Give me an inch, sir,
I'll soon take an ell.
"Drive me from garden In anger and pride,
I'll thrive and harden
By the road-side.
"Not a bit fearful,
Showing my face,
Always so cheerful In every place."
Said young Dandelion,
With a sweet air,
"I have my eye on
Miss Daisy fair.
"Though we may tarry
Till past the cold,
Her I will marry
Ere I grow old.
"I will protect her
From all kinds of harm,
Feed her with nectar,
Shelter her warm.
JOHN GILPIN
"Whate'er the weather,
Let it go by;
We'll hold together,
Daisy and I.
"I'll ne'er give in-no!
Nothing I fear ;
All that I win, oh!
I'll keep for my dear."
Said young Dandelion Onhis hedge-side,
"Who'll me rely on?
Who'll be my bride?"
