EAR the sledges with the bellsSilver bells !
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight ;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells !
What aworld of happiness their harmony foretells !
Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight !
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What agush of euphony voluminously wells !
How it swells !
How it dwells

THE BELLS
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells !
Hear the loud alarum bellsBrazen bells !
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright !
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
Inthe clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In amad expostulation with the deaf and frantic
fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
