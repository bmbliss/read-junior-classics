AH, days then! how sweetly closed those crowded The minutes parting one by one like rays, That fade upon a summer's eve. But O, what charm or magic numbers Can give me back the gentle slumbers Those weary, happy days did leave? MARCH Whenby my bed I saw my mother kneel, And with her blessing took her nightly kiss ; Whatever Time destroys, he cannot this;- E'en now that nameless kiss I feel.
