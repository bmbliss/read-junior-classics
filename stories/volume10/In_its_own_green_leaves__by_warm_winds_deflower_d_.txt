Till the scent it gives Makes faint with too much sweet these heavywing√®d thieves.


Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was,
Joyous and clear and fresh-thy music doth
surpass.
Teach us, sprite or bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine :
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus hymeneal
Or triumphal chaunt,
Match'd with thine, would be all
But an empty vauntA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden
want.
What objects are the fountains Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of
pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.


Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet, if we could scorn,
Hate and pride, and fear;
If we were things born Not to shed a tear,
Iknow not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Ofdelightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know;
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow The world should listen then as I am listening now
