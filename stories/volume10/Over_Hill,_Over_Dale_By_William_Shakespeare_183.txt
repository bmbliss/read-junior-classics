VER hill, over dale, through brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moon's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green: The cowslips tall her pensioners be; INGRATITUDE In their gold coats spots you see; Those be rubies, fairy favors, In those freckles live their savors : Imust go seek some dew-drops here, Andhang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. -From "A Midsummer-Night's Dream."
