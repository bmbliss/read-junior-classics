in the steeple, ring out your changes,
How many soever they be,
Andlet the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges
Come over, come over to me.

SEVEN TIMES TWO
Yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling No magical sense conveys,
Andbells have forgotten their old art of telling
The fortune of future days.
" Turn again, turn again, " once they rang cheerily While a boy listened alone :
Made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily
All by himself on a stone.
Poor bells ! I forgive you; your good days are over,
Andmine, they are yet to be;
No listening, no longing, shall aught, aught discover:
You leave the story to me.
The foxglove shoots out of the green matted
heather,
Preparing her hoods of snow;
She was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather:
O, children take long to grow.
I wish, and I wish, that the spring would go
faster,
Nor long summer bide so late ;
AndI could grow on like the foxglove and aster,
For some things are ill to wait.
I wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover,
While dear hands are laid on my head;
"The child is a woman, the book may close only,
For all the lessons are said."

THE BAREFOOT BOY
Iwait for my story-the birds cannot sing it,
Not one, as he sits on the tree ;
The bells cannot ring it, but long years, O, bring it !
Such as I wish it to be.
