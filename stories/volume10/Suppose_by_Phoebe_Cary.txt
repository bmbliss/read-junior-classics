UPPOSE, my little lady,
Your doll should break her head;
Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose were red?
And wouldn't it be pleasanter
To treat it as a joke,
And say you're glad 'twas dolly's
And not your own that broke?
Suppose you're dressed for walking,
Andthe rain comes pouring down;
Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown?
And wouldn't it be nicer
For you to smile than pout,
And so make sunshine in the house
When there is none without?
Suppose your task, my little man,
Is very hard to get ;
Will it make it any easier
For you to sit and fret?
TO-DAY
And wouldn't it be wiser,
Than waiting like a dunce,
To go to work in earnest
And learn the thing at once?
Suppose that some boys have a horse,
And some a coach and pair ;
Will it tire you less while walking To say, " It isn't fair" ?
And wouldn't it be nobler
To keep your temper sweet,
And in your heart be thankful
You can walk upon your feet?
Suppose the world don't please you.
Nor the way some people do ;
Do you think the whole creation
Willbe altered just for you?
And isn't it, my boy or girl,
The wisest, bravest plan,
Whatever comes, or doesn't come,
To do the best you can?
