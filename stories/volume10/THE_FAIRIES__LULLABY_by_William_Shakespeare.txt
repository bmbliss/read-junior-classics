Enter TITANIA, with her train
TITANIA.
Come, now a roundel, and afairy
Then, for the third part of aminute, hence;-
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
Some, war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats; and some, keep back The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep ;
Then to your offices, and let me rest.
SONG
1 FAIRY. You spotted snakes, with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Nerets, and blind-worms, do no wrong;
Come not near our fairy queen.
CHORUS
Philomel, with melody,
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby :
Never harm,
Nor spell nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.

YELLOW SANDS
1 FAIRY. Weaving spiders, come not here;
Hence, you long-legged spinners hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
Worm, nor snail, do no offence.
CHORUS
Philomel, with melody,
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby :
Never harm,
Nor spell nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.
2 FAIRY. Hence, away! now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel!
-From "A Midsummer- Night's Dream. "
