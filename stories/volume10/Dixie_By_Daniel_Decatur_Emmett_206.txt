WISH I was in de land ob cotton, Old times dar am not forgotten, Look away! Look away! Look away! In Dixie Land where I was born in, Early on a frosty mornin', Look away! Look away! Look away! Den I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray! In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand, To lib and die in Dixie, Away! Away! Away down south in Dixie. Old Missus marry "Will-de-weaber," Willium was a gay deceaber ; Look away! Look away! Look away! But when he put his arm around 'er, He smiled as fierce as a forty-pounder, Look away! Look away! Look away! His face was as sharp as a butcher's cleaber, But dat did not seem to greab 'er ; Look away! Look away! Look away! Old Missus acted de foolish part, Anddied for amandat broke her heart. Look away! Look away! Look away! Nowhere's a health to de next old Missus, And all de gals dat want to kiss us ; Look away! Look away! Look away! RULE BRITANNIA But if you want to drive 'way sorrow, Come and hear dis song to-morrow, Look away! Look away! Look away! Dar's buckwheat cakes an' Injen batter, Makes you fat or a little fatter ; Look away! Look away! Look away! Denhoe it down and scratch your grabble, To Dixie's Land I'm bound to trabble, Look away! Look away! Look away!
