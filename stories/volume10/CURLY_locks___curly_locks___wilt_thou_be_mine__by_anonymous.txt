CURLY locks ! curly locks ! wilt thou be mine?
Thou shalt not wash dishes, nor yet feed the swine,
But sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam,
And feed upon strawberries, sugar, and cream!
THE north wind doth blow,
And we shall have snow,
And what will poor Robin do then?
He'll sit in a barn,
Poor thing!
And to keep himself warm,
Will hide his head under his wing.
Poor thing!
