SPREAD the tidings afar to the nations, Let them learn from the freedom of Spain, For the laws are the people's salvation, And our King as their servant shall reign. For their country, true Spaniards will dare it, Dare to perish for Liberty's cause To the tories' destruction, we swear it! Live forever the King andthe laws.
