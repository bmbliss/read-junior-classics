N an ocean, 'way out yonder (As all sapient people know) ,
Is the land of Wonder-Wander,
Whither children love to go ;
It's their playing, romping, swinging,
That give great joy to me While the Dinkey-Bird goes singing In the amfalula tree.
There the gumdrops grow like cherries,
And taffy's thick as peas
Caramels you pick like berries
When, and where, and how you please;
Big red sugar-plums are clinging To the cliffs beside that sea
Where the Dinkey-Bird is singing
In the amfalula tree.
So when children shout and scamper And make merry all the day,
When there's naught to put a damper
To the ardor of their play;
HOLLYHOCK
When I hear their laughter ringing,
Then I'm sure as sure can be
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula tree.
For the Dinkey-Bird's bravuras
And staccatos are so sweetHis roulades, appoggiaturas,
And robustos so complete,
That the youth of every nationBe they near or far away- Have especial delectation
In that gladsome roundelay.
Their eyes grow bright and brighter,
Their lungs begin to crow,
Their hearts get light and lighter,
And their cheeks are all aglow;
For an echo cometh bringing
The news to all and me,
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula trec.
