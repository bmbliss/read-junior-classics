S there, for honest poverty, That hangs his head, and a' that? The coward slave, we pass him by, Wedare be poor for a' that ; For a' that, and a' that, Our toils obscure, and a' that; The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gowd for a' that! What though onhamely fare we dine, Wearhoddin-gray,' and a' that; Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, Aman's a man for a' that! For a' that, and a' that, Their tinsel show, and a' that; Thehonest man, though e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that ! Ye see yon birkie ca'd alord, Wha struts, and stares, and a' that; Though hundreds worship at his word, He's but a coof for a' that; Coarse woolen clothes. * Impudent fellow. Fool, blockhead. PROCRASTINATION For a' that, and a' that, His riband, star, and a' that, Theman of independent mind, He looks and laughs at a' that. Aprince can make a belted knight, Amarquis, duke, and a' that ; But an honest man's aboon his might, Guid faith he maunna fa' that ! For a' that, and a' that, Their dignities, and a' that, The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth, Are higher rank than a' that. Then let us pray that come it mayAs come it will for a' thatThat sense and worth, o'er a' the earth, Maybear the gree, and a' that ; For a' that, and a' that, It's coming yet for a' that, That man to man, the warld o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that!
