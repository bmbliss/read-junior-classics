HERE'S no dew left on the daisies and clover ;
There's no rain left in heaven;
I've said my"seven times" over and over- Seven times one are seven.
I am old! so old I can write a letter ;
My birthday lessons are done:
The lambs play always, they know no better ;
They are only one times one.
OMoon! in the night I have seen you sailing,
And shining so round and low;
You were bright! ah, bright! but your light is failing;
You are nothing now but abow.


You Moon! have you done something wrong in
heaven,
That God has hidden your face?
I hope if you have, you will soonbe forgiven,
And shine again in your place.
O velvet Bee! you're a dusty fellow,
You've powdered your legs with gold;
O brave marsh Mary-buds, rich and yellow!
Give me your money to hold.
O Columbine! open your folded wrapper Where two twin turtle-doves dwell;
O Cuckoo-pint! toll me the purple clapper,
That hangs in your clear, green bell.
Andshow me your nest with the young ones in it I will not steal them away,
Iam old! you may trust me, Linnet, Linnet- I am seven times one to-day.
