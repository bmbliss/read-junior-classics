OOK on this cast and know the hand
That bore a nation in its hold :
From this mute witness understand
What Lincoln was-how large of mould.
The man who sped the woodman's team,
Anddeepest sunk the ploughman's share,
Andpushed the laden raft astream,
Of fate before him unaware.
This was the hand that knew to swing The axe-since thus would Freedom train
Her son-and made the forest ring,
Anddrove the wedge and toiled amain.
Firmhand, that loftier office took,
Aconscious leader's will obeyed,
And, when men sought his word and look,
With steadfast might the gathering swayed.

THE HAND OF LINCOLN
No courtier's toying with a sword,
Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute;
A chief's, uplifted to the Lord
When all the kings of earth were mute!
The hand of Anak, sinewed strong,
The fingers that on greatness clutch;
Yet, lo! the marks their lines along Of one who strove and suffered much.
For here in knotted cord and vein
I trace the varying chart of years ;
Iknow the troubled heart, the strain,
The weight of Atlas-and the tears.
Again I see the patient brow
That palm erewhile was wont to press ;
Andnow 'tis furrowed deep, and now
Made smooth with hope and tenderness.
For something of aformless grace
This moulded outline plays about;
Apitying flame, beyond our trace,
Breathes like a spirit, in and outThe love that cast an aureole
Round one who, longer to endure,
Called mirth to ease his ceaseless dole,
Yet kept his nobler purpose sure.
Lo, as I gaze, the statured man,
Built up from yon large hand, appears:
Atype that nature wills to plan
But once in all a people's years.

BATTLE HYMN
What better than this voiceless cast
To tell of such a one as he,
Since through its living semblance passed
The thought that bade a race be free !
BATTLE- HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC
