TEbuilt W
a ship upon the stairs All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
And filled it full of sofa pillows
To go a-sailing on the billows.


We took a saw and several nails,
Andwater in the nursery pails ;
And Tom said, "Let us also take
An apple and a slice of cake;"_
Which was enough for Tom and me
To go a-sailing on, till tea.
We sailed along for days and days,
Andhad the very best of plays ;
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
So there was no one left but me.
