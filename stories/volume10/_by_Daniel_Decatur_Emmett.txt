WISH I was in de land ob cotton,
Old times dar am not forgotten,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
In Dixie Land where I was born in,
Early on a frosty mornin',
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Den I wish I was in Dixie,
Hooray! Hooray!
In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand,
To lib and die in Dixie,
Away! Away!
Away down south in Dixie.
Old Missus marry "Will-de-weaber,"
Willium was a gay deceaber ;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
But when he put his arm around 'er,
He smiled as fierce as a forty-pounder,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
His face was as sharp as a butcher's cleaber,
But dat did not seem to greab 'er ;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Old Missus acted de foolish part,
Anddied for amandat broke her heart.
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Nowhere's a health to de next old Missus,
And all de gals dat want to kiss us ;
Look away! Look away! Look away!


But if you want to drive 'way sorrow,
Come and hear dis song to-morrow,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Dar's buckwheat cakes an' Injen batter,
Makes you fat or a little fatter ;
Look away! Look away! Look away!
Denhoe it down and scratch your grabble,
To Dixie's Land I'm bound to trabble,
Look away! Look away! Look away!
