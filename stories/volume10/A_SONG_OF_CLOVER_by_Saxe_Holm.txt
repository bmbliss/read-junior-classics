WONDER what the Clover thinks,
Intimate friend of Bob-o' -links,
Lover of Daisies slim and white,
Waltzer with Buttercups at night ;
Keeper of Inn for travelling Bees,
Serving to them wine-dregs and lees,
Left by the Royal Humming Birds,
Who sip and pay with fine-spun words;

A STORM
I
Fellow with all the lowliest,
Peer of the gayest and the best;
Comrade of winds, beloved of sun,
Kissed by the Dew-drops one by one;
Prophet of Good-luck mystery By sign of four which few may see;
Symbol of Nature's magic zone;
One out of three, and three in one;
Emblem of comfort in the speech
Which poor men's babies early reach;
Sweet by the roadsides, sweet by rills,
Sweet in the meadows, sweet on hills,
Sweet in its white, sweet in its redOh, half its sweetness cannot be said;-
Sweet in its every living breath.
Sweetest, perhaps, at last indeath!
Oh, whoknows what the Clover thinks ?
No one! unless the Bob-o' -links !
