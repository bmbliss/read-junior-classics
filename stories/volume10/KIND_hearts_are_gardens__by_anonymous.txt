KIND hearts are gardens,
Kind thoughts are roots,
Kind words are blossoms,
Kind deeds are fruits.
I HAD a little pony They called him Dapple-grey.
I lent him to a lady,
To ride a mile away.
She whipped him, she slashed him,
She rode him through the mire.
I would not lend my pony now,
For all the lady's hire.
