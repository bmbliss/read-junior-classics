AM coming, I am coming!
Hark! the little bee is humming;
See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky;
And the gnats are on the wing,
Wheeling round in airy ring.
See the yellow catkins cover
All the slender willows over !
And on the banks of mossy green Star-like primroses are seen;
And, their clustering leaves below,
White and purple violets blow.
Hark! the new-born lambs are bleating,
Andthe cawing rooks are meeting In the elms a noisy crowd;
All the birds are singing loud ;
And the first white butterfly Inthe sunshine dances by.

GREEN THINGS GROWING
Look around thee, look around!
Flowers in all the fields abound:
Every running stream is bright ;
All the orchard trees are white;
And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit.
Turn thine eyes to earth and heaven:
God for thee the spring has given,
Taught the birds their melodies,
Clothed the earth and cleared the skies
For thy pleasure or thy food;
Pour thy soul in gratitude.
