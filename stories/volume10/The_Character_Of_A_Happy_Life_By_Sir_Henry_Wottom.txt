is he born and taught HowThathappy servethis not another's will; Whose armor is his honest thought, And simple truth his utmost skill ; Whose passions not his masters are ; Whose soul is still prepared for death, Untied unto the world by care Of public fame or private breath; THE RHODORA Who envies none that chance doth raise, Nor vice ; who never understood Howdeepest wounds are given by praise ; Nor rules of state, but rules of good; Who hath his life from rumors freed; Whoseconscience is his strong retreat ; Whose state can neither flatterers feed, Nor ruin make oppressors great ; Who God doth late and early pray More of his grace than gifts to lend ; And entertains the harmless day With a religious book or friend. This man is freed from servile bands Of hope to rise or fear to fall : Lord of himself, though not of lands, And, having nothing, yet hath all.
