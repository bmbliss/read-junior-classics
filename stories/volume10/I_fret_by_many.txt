a field and fallow,
Andmany
a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow
.
I chatter, chatter
, as
I flow
To join the brimming river
,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
Iwind about
, and in and out,
With here
a blossom sailing
,
Andhere and there
a lusty trout,
Andhere and there
agrayling
,
And here and there
a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak
Above the golden gravel,


And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
I slide by hazel covers ;
I move the sweet forget-me-nots
That grow for happy lovers.
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
Among my skimming swallows ;
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy shallows.
I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesses ;
Ilinger by my shingly bars ;
I loiter round my cresses ;
'And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
