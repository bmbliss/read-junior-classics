WHENAnd mytheweary busyday littleisone done,
Rocketh gently to and fro ;
When the night winds softly blow,
And the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again;
When upon the haunted green Fairies dance around their queenThen from yonder misty skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
:
Through the murk and mist and gloam
To our quiet, cosy home,
Where to singing, sweet and low,
Rocks a cradle to and fro ;
Where the clock's dull monotone
Telleth of the day that's done;

LADY BUTTON- EYES
Where the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor- Where my weary wee one lies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Cometh like a fleeting ghost
From some distant eerie coast;
Never footfall can you hear
As that spirit fareth nearNever whisper, never word From that shadow-queen is heard.
In ethereal raiment dight,
From the realm of fay and sprite
In the depth of yonder skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Layeth she her hands upon My dear weary little one,
And those white hands overspread
Like a veil the curly head,
Seem to fondle and caress
Every little silken tress ;
Then she smooths the eyelids down
Over those two eyes of brown- In such soothing, tender wise Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Dearest, feel upon your brow That caressing magic now;
For the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again,
While upon the haunted green
Fairies dance around their queen,

THE ROCK-A- BY LADY
And the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor- Hush, my sweet! from yonder skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes !
