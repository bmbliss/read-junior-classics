OME, my little one, with me!
There are wondrous sights to see As the evening shadows fall;
Inyour pretty cap and gown,
Don't detain
The Shut-Eye train-
"Ting-a-ling !" the bell it goeth,
"Toot-toot ! " the whistle bloweth,
And we hear the warning call:
"All aboard for Shut-Eye Toron!"
THE SHUT-EYE TRAIN
Over hill and over plain
Soon will speed the Shut-Eye train!
Through the blue where bloom the stars
And the Mother Moon looks down
We'll away
To land of FayOh, the sights that we shall see there!
Come, my little one, with me there-
'Tis a goodly train of carsAll aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
Swifter than a wild bird's flight,
Through the realms of fleecy light We shall speed and speed away!
Let the Night in envy frownWhat care we
How wroth she be!
To the Balow-land above us,
To the Balow-folk who love us,
Let us hasten while we mayAll aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
Shut-Eye Town is passing fair- Golden dreams await us there ;
We shall dream those dreams, mydear,
Till the Mother Moon goes downSeeunfold
Delights untold!
Andin those mysterious places We shall see beloved faces
Andbeloved voices hear
In the grace of Shut-Eye Town.
AMORTIFYING MISTAKE
Heavy are your eyes, my sweet,
Weary are your little feet- Nestle closer up to me
In your pretty cap and gown;
Don't detain
The Shut-Eye train!
"Ting-a-ling! " the bell it goeth,
"Toot-toot ! " the whistle bloweth;
Oh, the sights that we shall see !
All aboard for Shut-Eye Town!
