HE breaking waves dash'd high Onastern and rock-bound coast, And the woods against a stormy sky Their giant branches toss'd ; And theheavy night hungdark The hills and waters o'er, When aband of exiles moor'd their bark Onthe wild New England shore, THE PILGRIM FATHERS Not as the conqueror comes, They, the true-hearted, came; Not with the roll of the stirring drums, And the trumpet that sings of fame; Not as the flying come, In silence and in fear ; - They shook the depths of the desert gloom With their hymns of lofty cheer. Amidst the storm they sang, And the stars heard and the sea; Andthesoundingaisles of thedimwoodsrang To the anthem of the free! The ocean eagle soar'd Fromhis nest by the white wave's foam; And the rocking pines of the forest roar'd- This was their welcome home! There were men with hoary hair Amidst that pilgrim band;— Why had they come to wither there, Away from their childhood's land? There was woman's fearless eye, Lit by her deep love's truth ; There was manhood's brow serenely high, And the fiery heart of youth. What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine? The wealth of seas, the spoils of war ? They sought a faith's pure shrine ! THE EVE OF WATERLOO Ay, call it holy ground, The soil where first they trod. They have left unstain'd what there they foundFreedom to worship God.
