TAND! the ground's your own, my braves!
Will ye give it up to slaves?
Will ye look for greener graves?
Hope ye mercy still?
What's the mercy despots feel?
Hear it in that battle-peal!
Read it on yon bristling steel!
Ask it-ye who will.
Fear ye foes who kill for hire?
Will ye to your homes retire ?
Look behind you! they're afire!
And before you, see
Who have done it ! From the vale
On they come-And ! will ye quail?
Leaden rain and iron hail
Let their welcome be!


Inthe God of battles trust!
Die we may-and die we must;
But, O, where can dust to dust
Be consigned so well,
As where Heaven its dews shall shed
On the martyred patriot's bed,
And the rocks shall raise their head,
Of his deeds to tell !
