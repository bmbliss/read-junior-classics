EAR mother, how pretty The moon looks to-night! She was never so cunning before; Her two little horns Are so sharp and so bright, Ihope she'll not grow any more. If I were up there, With you and my friends, I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see; I'd sit in the middle Andhold by both ends ; Oh, what abright cradle 'twould be! Iwould call to the stars To keep out of the way, Lest we should rock over their toes ; And then I would rock Till the dawn of the day, And see where the pretty moon goes. THE SPIDER AND THE FLY And there we would stay In the beautiful skies, And through the bright clouds we would roam We would see the sun set, And see the sun rise, And on the next rainbow come home.
