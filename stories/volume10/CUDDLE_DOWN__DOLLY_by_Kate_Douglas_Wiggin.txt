HEY sent me to bed, dear, so dreadfully early,
I hadn't a moment to talk to my girlie
But while Nurse is getting her dinner downstairs,
I'll rock you a little and hear you your prayers.
Cuddle down, dolly,
Cuddle down, dear!
Here on my shoulder you've nothing to fear.
That's what Mamma sings to me every night,
Cuddle down, dolly dear, shut your eyes tight!
Not comfor'ble dolly ?-or why do you fidget ?
You're hurting my shoulder, you troublesome midget!
Perhaps it's that hole that you told me about.
Why, darling, your sawdust is trick-ker-ling out!


We'll call the good doctor in, right straight away;
This can't be neglected a single more day;
I'll wet my new hankchif and tie it round tight,
'T will keep you from suffering pains in the night.
I hope you've been good, little dolly, to-day,
Not cross to your nursie, nor rude in your play;
Nor dabbled your feet in those puddles of water
The way
*
you did
*
yesterday, bad little daughter !
*
*
*
Oh, dear! I'm so sleepy-can't hold up my head,
I'll sing one more verse, then I'll creep into bed.
Cuddle down, dolly,
Here on my arm,
Nothing shall frighten you, nothing shall harm,
Cuddle down sweetly, my little pink rose,
Good angels come now and guard thy repose.
