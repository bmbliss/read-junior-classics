LL night long and every night, AWhenmy mamma puts out the light, Isee the people marching by, Asplain as day, before my eye. Armies and emperors and kings, All carrying different kinds of things, Andmarching in so grand away, You never saw the like by day. LULLABY So fine a show was never seen Atthe great circus on the green ; For every kind of beast and man Is marching in that caravan. At first they move a little slow, But still the faster on they go, And still beside them close I keep Until we reach the town of Sleep.
