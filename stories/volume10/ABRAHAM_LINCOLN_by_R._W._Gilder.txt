HIS bronze doth keep the very form and THIS bron
Of our great martyr's face. Yes, this is he:
That brow all wisdom, all benignity;
That human, humorous mouth; those cheeks that
hold
Like some harsh landscape all the summer's gold;
That spirit fit for sorrow, as the sea
For storms to beat on; the lone agony


Those silent patient lips too well foretold.
Yes, this is he who ruled a world of men
As might some prophet of the elder dayBrooding above the tempest and the fray With deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken.
Apower was his beyond the touch of art Or armÃ«d strength-his pure and mighty heart.
THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT
