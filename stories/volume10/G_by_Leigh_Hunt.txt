REEN little vaulter in the sunny grass,
Catching your heart up at the feel of June Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon
Wheneven the bees lag at the summoning brass ;
And you, warm little housekeeper, who class
With those who think the candles come too soon,
Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune
Nick the glad silent moments as they pass !


O sweet and tiny cousins, that belong,
One to the fields, the other to the hearth,
Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are
strong
At your clear hearts ; and both seem given to earth
To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song- In doors and out, summer and winter, mirth.
THE ANT AND THE CRICKET
Anonymous
ASILLY Throughyoung the cricket warm,, accustomed sunny months to singgay
summer and spring,
Began to complain, whenhe found that at home
His cupboard was empty and winter was come.
Not a crumb to be found
On the snow-covered ground;
Not a flower could he see,
Not a leaf on a tree :
"Oh, what will become," says the cricket, "of me? "
At last, by starvation and famine made bold,
All dripping with wet and all trembling with cold,
Awayhe set off to a miserly ant,
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant Him shelter from rain;
Amouthful of grain
He wished only to borrow,
He'd repay it to-morrow ;
If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.


Says the ant to the cricket, "I'm your servant and
friend,
But we ants never borrow, we ants never lend;
But tell me, dear sir, did you lay nothing by When the weather was warm?" Said the cricket,
Not I.
My heart is so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay"-
"You sang, sir, you say?
Gothen," said the ant, "and dance winter away."
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Though this is afable, the moral is good:
If you live without work, you must live without food.
