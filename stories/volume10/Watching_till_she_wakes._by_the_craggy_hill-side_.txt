Through the mosses bare
,
They have planted thorn trees
For pleasure here and there
.
Isanymanso daring
As dig one up in spite
?
He shall find the thornies set
Inhis bed at night.
Upthe airy mountain,
Down the rushyglen,

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
We daren't go a-hunting For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together;
Green jacket, red cap,
And white owl's feather.
THE VOWELS: AN ENIGMA
