Ycountry, 'tis of thee,
Of thee I sing ;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the Pilgrims' pride;
From every mountain side,
Let Freedom ring.
My native country, thee- Land of the noble freeThy name I love ;
I love thy rocks and rills ,
Thy woods and templed hills ;
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.
Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees
Sweet Freedom's song;
Let mortal tongues awake,
Let all that breathe partake,
Let rocks their silence breakThe sound prolong.


Our fathers' God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing ;
Long may our land be bright With Freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King.
