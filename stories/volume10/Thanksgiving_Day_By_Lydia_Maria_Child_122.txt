VER the river and through the wood,
To grandfather's house we go;
The horse knows the way
To carry the sleigh
Through the white and drifted snow,
Over the river and through the wood- Oh, how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes,
And bites the nose,
As over the ground we go.
THE SWAN'S NEST
Over the river and through the wood,
To have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring,
"Ting-a-ling-ding! "
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day !
Over the river and through the wood Trot fast, mydapple-gray!
Spring over the ground,
Like a hunting-hound!
For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river and through the wood,
And straight through the barnyard gate.
Weseem to go Extremely slowIt is so hard to wait !
Over the river and through the woodNow grandmother's cap I spy !
Hurrah for the fun!
Is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!
