IONCE The prettiest hadasweet doll little doll, dears,
Her cheeks were so red and white, dears,
And her hair was so charmingly curled.
But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
As I played on the heath one day;
AndI cried for her more than a week, dears,
But I never could find where she lay.


Ifound my poor little doll, dears,
As I played on the heath oneday;
Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
For her paint is all washed away,
Andher arms trodden off by the cows, dears,
Andher hair not the least bit curled;
Yet for old sakes' sake, she is still, dears,
The prettiest doll inthe world.
