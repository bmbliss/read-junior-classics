"Not a bit fearful,
Showing my face,
Always so cheerful In every place."
Said young Dandelion,
With a sweet air,
"I have my eye on
Miss Daisy fair.
"Though we may tarry
Till past the cold,
Her I will marry
Ere I grow old.
"I will protect her
From all kinds of harm,
Feed her with nectar,
Shelter her warm.


"Whate'er the weather,
Let it go by;
We'll hold together,
Daisy and I.
"I'll ne'er give in-no!
Nothing I fear ;
All that I win, oh!
I'll keep for my dear."
:
Said young Dandelion Onhis hedge-side,
"Who'll me rely on?
Who'll be my bride?"
