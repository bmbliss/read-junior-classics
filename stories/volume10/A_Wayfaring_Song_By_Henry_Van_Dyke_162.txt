WHO will walk amile with me Along life's merry way? Acomrade blithe and full of glee, Who dares to laugh out loud and free, And let his frolic fancy play, Like ahappy child, through the flowers gay That fill the field and fringe the way Where he walks a mile with me. And who will walk a mile with me Along life's weary way? Afriend whose heart has eyes to see The stars shine out o'er the darkening lea, Andthe quiet rest at the end o' the dayA friend who knows and dares to say, The brave, sweet words that cheer the way Where he walks a mile with me. THE ARROW AND THE SONG With such a comrade, such a friend, I fain would walk till journey's end, Through summer sunshine, winter rain, Andthen?-Farewell, we shall meet again!
