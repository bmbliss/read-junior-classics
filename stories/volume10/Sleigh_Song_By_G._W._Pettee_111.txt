INGLE, jingle, clear the way, 'Tis the merry, merry sleigh, As it swiftly scuds along Hear the burst of happy song, See the gleam of glances bright, Flashing o'er the pathway white. Jingle, jingle, past it flies, COME, LITTLE LEAVES Sending shafts from hooded eyes, Roguish archers, I'll be bound, Little heeding who they wound; See them, with capricious pranks, Ploughing now the drifted banks; Jingle, jingle, mid the glee Who among them cares for me? Jingle, jingle, on they go, Capes and bonnets white with snow, Not a single robe they fold To protect them from the cold; Jingle, jingle, mid the storm, Fun and frolic keep them warm; Jingle, jingle, down the hills, O'er the meadows, past the mills, Now 'tis slow, and now 'tis fast; Winter will not always last. Jingle, jingle, clear the way, 'Tis the merry, merry sleigh.
