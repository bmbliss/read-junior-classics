Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing
AWN as white as driven snow ;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses ;
Masks for faces and for noses ;
Bugle bracelet, necklace-amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber :
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears ;
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,


What maids lack from head to heel :
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy ;
Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry:
Come buy. -From " The Winter's Tale."
