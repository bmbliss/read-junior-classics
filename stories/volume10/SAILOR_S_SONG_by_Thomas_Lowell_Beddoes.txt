O sea, to sea! The calm is o'er;
The wanton water leaps in sport,
And rattles down the pebbly shore ;
The dolphin wheels, the sea cows snort,
Andunseen mermaids' pearly song
Comes bubbling up, the weeds among.
Fling broad the sail, dip deep the oar:
To sea, to sea! the calm is o'er.
To sea, to sea! our wide-winged bark Shall billowy cleave its sunny way,
And with its shadow, fleet and dark,
Break the caved Triton's azure day,

THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
T
Like mighty eagle soaring light
O'er antelopes on Alpine height.
The anchor heaves, the ship swings free,
The sails swell full. To sea, to sea!
THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
