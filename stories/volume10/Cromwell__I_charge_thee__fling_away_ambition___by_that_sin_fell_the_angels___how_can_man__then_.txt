The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate
thee:
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:

WOLSEY'S FALL
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O
Cromwell!
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the king;
And-pr'ythee, lead me in:
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny; 'tis the king's : my robe,
And my integrity to heaven, is all Idare now call mine own. ÎŸ Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies !
-From "Henry VIII."
