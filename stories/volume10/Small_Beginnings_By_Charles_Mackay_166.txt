TRAVELLER through a dusty road strewed acorns on the lea ; And one took root and sprouted up, and grew into a tree. Love sought its shade, at evening time, to breathe its early vows ; And age was pleased, in heats of noon, to bask beneath its boughs ; The dormouse loved its dangling twigs, the birds sweet music bore; It stood a glory in its place, a blessing evermore. SMALL BEGININNGS Alittle spring had lost its way amid the grass and fern, Apassing stranger scooped a well, where weary men might turn; He walled it in, and hung with care a ladle at the brink; He thought not of the deed he did, but judged that toil might drink. He passed again, and lo! the well, by summers never dried, Had cooled ten thousand parching tongues, and saved a life beside. Adreamer dropped a random thought; 'twas old, and yet 'twas new; Ásimple fancy of the brain, but strong in being true. It shone upon a genial mind, and lo! its light became Alamp of life, abeacon ray, amonitory flame. The thought was small; its issue great; a watch-fire on the hill ; It sheds its radiance far adown, and cheers the valley still! Anameless man, amid acrowd that thronged the daily mart, Let fall a word of Hope and Love, unstudied from the heart; A whisper on the tumult thrown-a transitory breathIt raised a brother from the dust; it saved a soul from death. Jun, Cl-10 259 OPPORTUNITY O germ! O fount! O word of love! O thought at random cast ! Ye were but little at the first, but mighty at the last.
