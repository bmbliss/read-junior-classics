ARK! I hear the tramp of thousands,
And of arm√®d men the hum;
Lo! a nation's hosts have gathered Round the quick alarming drumSaying, "Come,
Freemen, come,
Ere your heritage be wasted," said the quick alarmdrum.
THE DRUM
"Let me of my heart take counsel:
War is not of life the sum;
Who shall stay and reap the harvest When the autumn days shall come?"
But the drum
Echoed, " Come!
Death shall reap the braver harvest," said the sol- emn-sounding drum.
"But when won the coming battle,
What of profit springs therefrom?
What if conquest, subjugation,
Even greater ills become?"
But the drum
Answered, "Come!
You must do the sum to prove it," said the Yan kee-answering drum.
"What if, 'mid the cannon's thunder,
Whistling shot and bursting bomb,
When my brothers fall around me,
Should my heart grow cold and numb?"
But the drum
Answered, "Come!
Better there in death united, than in life a recreant,
-Come!"
Thus they answered-hoping, fearing,
Some in faith, and doubting some,
Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming,
Said, "My chosen people, come!"
Then the drum,
Lo! was dumb,
For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, an swered, "Lord, we come!"
