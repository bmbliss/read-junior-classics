WENTY froggies went to school, Down beside a rushy pool, Twenty little coats of green, Twenty vests all white and clean. "We must be in time," said they, ... "First we study, then we play; That is how we keep the rule, When we froggies go to school." Master Bull-frog, brave and stern, Called his classes in their turn, Taught them how to nobly strive, Alsohow to leap and dive; A CHILD'S EVEN SONG Taught them how to dodge a blow, From the sticks that bad boys throw. Twenty froggies grew up fast, Bull-frogs they became at last ; Polished in a high degree, As each froggie ought to be, Now they sit on other logs, Teaching other little frogs.
