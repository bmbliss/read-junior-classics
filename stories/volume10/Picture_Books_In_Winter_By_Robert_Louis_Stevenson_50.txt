UMMER fading, winter comesWindow robins, winter rooks,
Andthe picture story-books.
Water now is turned to stone
Nurse and I can walk upon;
Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by Wait upon the children's eye,
Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
In the picture story-books.
Wemay see how all things are,
Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies' looks,
In the picture story-books.
THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
How am I to sing your praise,
Happy chimney-corner days,
Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
Reading picture story-books ?
