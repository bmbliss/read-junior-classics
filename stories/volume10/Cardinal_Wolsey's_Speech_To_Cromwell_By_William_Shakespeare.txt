ROMWELL, Idid not think to shed a tear In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me, Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. Let's dry our eyes : and thus far hear me, Cromwell ; And-when I am forgotten, as I shall be, And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention Of me more must be heard of-say, I taught thee, Say, Wolsey-that once trod the ways of glory, And sounded all the depths and shoals of honorFound thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in; Asure and safe one, though thy master missed it. Mark but my fall, and that that ruined me. Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition : By that sin fell the angels ; how can man, then, The image of his Maker, hope to win by't? Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee: Corruption wins not more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not: WOLSEY'S FALL Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell! Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the king; And-pr'ythee, lead me in: There take an inventory of all I have, To the last penny; 'tis the king's : my robe, And my integrity to heaven, is all Idare now call mine own. Ο Cromwell, Cromwell! Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies ! -From "Henry VIII."
