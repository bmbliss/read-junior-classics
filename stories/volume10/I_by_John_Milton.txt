WHEN and consider how my light is spent
wide;
And that one talent which is death to hide,
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest he returning chide;
Doth God exact day-labor, light denied,

TO MILTON
I fondly ask? But Patience, to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need
Either man's work or his own gifts; who best Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best: his state Is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed,
And post o'er land and ocean without rest ;
They also serve who only stand and wait.
