O CANADA! in praise of thee we sing,
From echoing hills our anthems proudly ring.
With fertile plains and mountains grand,
With lakes and rivers clear,
Eternal beauty thou dost stand Throughout the changing year.
Lord God of Hosts! we now implore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore.

Dear Canada! for thee our fathers wrought,
Thy good and ours unselfishly they sought.
With steadfast hand and fearless mind
They felled the forest domes,
Content at last to leave behind
Aheritage of homes.
Lord God of Hosts! we now implore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore.
Blest Canada! the homeland that we love.
Thy freedom came a gift from God above.
Thy righteous laws, thy justice fair,
Give matchless liberty ;
We thank our God that we may share
Thy glorious destiny.
Lord God of Hosts ! we now implore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore,
Bless our dear land this day and evermore.
