VER hill, over dale,
through brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green:
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;

INGRATITUDE
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favors,
In those freckles live their savors :
Imust go seek some dew-drops here,
Andhang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
