WILL you walk into my parlor?"
said a spider to a fly;
" Tis the prettiest little parlor That ever you did spy.
The way into my parlor.
Is up a winding stair,
And I have many pretty things To show when you are there."
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"To ask me is in vain;
For who goes up your winding stair Can ne'er come down again."
"I'm sure you must be weary With soaring up so high;
Will you rest upon mylittle bed?"
Said the spider to the fly.
"There are pretty curtains drawn around,
The sheets are fine and thin;
And if you like to rest awhile,
I'll snugly tuck you in. "


"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"For I've often heard it said,
They never, never wake again
Who sleep upon your bed."
Said the cunning spider to the fly,
"Dear friend, what shall I do
To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?
I have within my pantry Good store of all that's nice ;
I'm sure you're very welcome- Willyou please to take a slice?"
"Oh, no, no! " said the little fly,
"Kind sir, that cannot be;
I've heard what's in your pantry,
And I do not wish to see."
"Sweet creature," said the spider,
"You're witty and you're wise ;
How handsome are your gauzy wings,
How brilliant are your eyes.
I have a little looking-glass Upon my parlor shelf ;
If you'll step in one moment, dear,
You shall behold yourself."
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,
"For what you're pleased to say,
And bidding you good-morning, now,
I'll call another day."
The spider turned him round about,
And went into his den,


For well he knew the silly fly
Would soon be back again;
So he wove a subtle thread
In a little corner sly,
And set his table ready
To dine upon the fly.
Hewent out to his door again,
Andmerrily did sing,
"Come hither, hither, pretty fly,
With the pearl and silver wing;
Your robes are green and purple,
There's a crest upon your head;
Your eyes are like the diamond bright,
But mine are dull as lead."
Alas, alas ! how very soon This silly little fly,
Hearing his wily, flattering words,
Came slowly flitting by:
With buzzing wings she hung aloft,
Then near and nearer drewThought only of her brilliant eyes,
Andgreen and purple hue;
Thought only of her crested head- Poor foolish thing ! At last Upjumped the cunning spider,
And fiercely held her fast.
Hedragged her up his winding stair,
Into his dismal den
Within his little parlor-but
She ne'er came out again!


And now, dear little children
Whomay this story read,
To idle, silly, flattering words,
I pray you, ne'er give heed:
Unto an evil counsellor
Close heart and ear and eye,
And learn alesson from this tale
Of the spider and the fly.
