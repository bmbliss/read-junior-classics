ID pleasures and palaces though we may MIDroam,
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like
home!
Acharm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home!
There's no place like home!


An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain!
Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!
The birds singing gayly that came at my call :-
Oh, give me sweet peace of mind, dearer than all !
Home, home, sweet, sweet home !
There's no place like home!
YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND
