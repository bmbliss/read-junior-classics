AID the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out!
You stare
In the air
As if crying 'Beware,'
Always looking what I am about :
I hate to be watched; I will blow you out !
The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.
So, deep
On a heap
Of clouds, to sleep,
Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon,
Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon!"
He turned in his bed: she was there again!
Onhigh
In the sky,
With her one ghost-eye The Moon shone white and alive and plain:
Said the Wind, "I will blow you out again!"
THE WIND AND THE MOON
The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew slim.
"With my sledge
And my wedge
I have knocked off her edge !
Iwill blow," said the Wind, "right fierce and grim,
And the creature will soon be slimmer than slim!"
He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.
"One puff
More's enough
To blow her to snuff !
One good puff more where the last was bred,
Andglimmer, glimmer, glum will go that thread!"
Heblew a great blast, and the thread wasgone.
In the air
Nowhere
Was a moonbeam bare ;
Larger and nearer the shy stars shone :
Sure and certain the Moon was gone!
The Wind he took to his revels once more ;
On down
Andin town,
A merry-mad clown,
He leaped and holloed with whistle and roarWhenthere was that glimmering thread once more!
He flew in a rage-he danced and blew ;
But in vain
Was the pain
Of his bursting brain,
For still the Moon-scrap the broader grew
The more that he swelled his big cheeks andblew.
SLEIGH SONG
Slowly she grew-till she filled the night,
And shone
On her throne
In the sky alone,
Amatchless, wonderful, silvery light,
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.
Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I !
With mybreath,
Ingood faith,
I blew her to death!
First blew her away right out of the sky,
Then blew her in: what a strength am I!"
But the Moon she knew naught of the silly affair;
For, high In the sky,
With her one white eye,
Motionless miles above the air,
She never had heard the great Windblare.
