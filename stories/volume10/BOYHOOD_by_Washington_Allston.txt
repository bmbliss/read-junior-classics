AH, days then! how sweetly closed those crowded
The minutes parting one by one like rays,
That fade upon a summer's eve.
But O, what charm or magic numbers
Can give me back the gentle slumbers
Those weary, happy days did leave?


Whenby my bed I saw my mother kneel,
And with her blessing took her nightly kiss ;
Whatever Time destroys, he cannot this;-
E'en now that nameless kiss I feel.
