BLOWmerry- , blow, winds blow,braggartwinds and
Blow down the almond snow, toss the flowering
cherry.
Daffodils ablow, arow, mingle intheir dances,
Shake the purple flags that grow tall amid their
lances.
Blow, O winds blow, strip the winter-berry!


Far and near, push and peer, here's a nest a
growing- Winds merry, winds dear, hush here your blowing!
Trouble not the mother-wren when she comes and
goes,
Dreaming of the wings and songs that her secret knowsSoft here, winds dear, where the nests are showing.
Blow, blow loud and low, wild winds and merry,
Hurtling down upon our heads bring a snow of
cherry.
Bring the yellow kingcups out in the flowerless
places,
Set the naked woods aflush with the wind-flowers'
faces.
Make the old briar run with sap ready for the berry,
Bring the swallows, April follows, wild winds and
merry.
