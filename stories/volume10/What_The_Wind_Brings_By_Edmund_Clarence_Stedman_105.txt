is the wind that brings the cold? WHICH The North is the- Wind wind, Freddy, and all the
snow;
And the sheep will scamper into the fold When the North begins to blow.
THE WIND
Which is the wind that brings the heat?
The South- Wind, Katy; and corn will grow,
And peaches redden for you to eat,
When the South begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the rain?
The East-Wind, Arty; and farmers know The cows come shivering up the lane When the East begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the flowers?
The West- Wind, Bessy; and soft and low
The birdies sing in the summer hours,
When the West begins to blow.
