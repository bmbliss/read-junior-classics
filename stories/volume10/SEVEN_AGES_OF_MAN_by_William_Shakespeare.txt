ALL the world's a stage,
Andall the men and women merely players :
They have their exits and their entrances ;
And one maninhis time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
Andshining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation Evenin the cannon's mouth. Andthen the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
Andsohe plays his part: the sixth age shifts

POLONIUS'S ADVICE
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side ;
His youthful hose, well saved, aworld too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivionSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
-From"As You Like It."
