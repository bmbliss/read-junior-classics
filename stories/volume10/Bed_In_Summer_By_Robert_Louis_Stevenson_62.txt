INwinter get up at night Anddress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
Ihave to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people's feet
Still going past me in the street.
Anddoes it not seem hard to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed byday?
