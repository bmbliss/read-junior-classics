OHN GILPIN was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
Atrain-band captain eke was he
Of famous London Town.
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
"Though wedded we have been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we No holiday have seen.
"To-morrow is our wedding-day,
Andwe will then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton,
All in achaise and pair.

JOHN GILPIN
"My sister and my sister's child,
Myself, and children three,
Will fill the chaise ; so you must ride On horseback after we."
He soon replied, "I do admire Of womankind but one,
And you are she, my dearest dear,
Therefore it shall be done.
"I am a linendraper bold,
As all the world doth know,
Andmy good friend, the Calender,
Will lend his horse to go."
Quoth Mistress Gilpin, "That's well said;
And, for that wine is dear,
Wewill be furnish'd with our own,
Which is both bright and clear."
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;
O'erjoy'd was he to find
That, though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.
The morning came, the chaise was brought,
But yet was not allow'd To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog To dash through thick and thin.

JOHN GILPIN
Smackwent the whip, round went the wheels ;
Were never folks so glad:
The stones did rattle underneath,
As if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin, at his horse's side,
Seized fast the flowing mane,
Andup he got, in haste to ride,
But soon came down again;
For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,
His journey to begin,
When, turning round his head, he saw
Three customers come in.
So down he came; for loss of time Although it grieved him sore,
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
Would trouble him much more.
'Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind,
When Betty, screaming, came downstairs,
"The wine is left behind!"
"Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
My leathern belt likewise,
In which I bear my trusty sword
When I do exercise."
Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
Had two stone-bottles found,
To hold the liquor that she loved,
Andkeep it safe and sound.

JOHN GILPIN
Each bottle had a curling ear,
Through which the belt he drew,
And hung a bottle on each side,
To make his balance true.
Then over all, that he might be
Equipp'd from top to toe,
His long red cloak, well-brush'd and neat,
He manfully did throw.
Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed,
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
With caution and good heed.
But finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot,
Which gall'd him in his seat.
So, "Fair and softly!" John he cried,
But John he cried in vain ;
That trot became agallop soon,
In spite of curb and rein.
So stooping down, as needs he must Who cannot sit upright,
He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,
And eke with all his might.
His horse, who never in that sort
Had handled been before,
What thing uponhis back had got Did wonder more and more.

JOHN GILPIN
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
Away went hat and wig;
He little dreamt, when he set out,
Of running such a rig.
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
Like streamer long and gay,
Till loop and button failing both,
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern The bottles he had slung;
Abottle swinging at each side,
Ashath been said or sung.
The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,
Up flew the windows all ;
Andevery soul cried out: "Well done!"
As loud as he could bawl.
Awaywent Gilpin-who but he?
His fame soon spread around,
"He carries weight; he rides a race!
'Tis for a thousand pound! "
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view
How in a trice the turnpike men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now, as he went bowing down His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shatter'd at a blow.

JOHN GILPIN
Down ran the wine into the road,
Most piteous to be seen,
Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
As they had basted been.
But still he seem'd to carry weight,
With leathern girdle braced ;
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington These gambols he did play,
Until he came unto the Wash
Of Edmonton so gay ;
And there he threw the Wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop,
Or awild goose at play.
AtEdmonton his loving wife From the balcony spied Her tender husband, wondering much To see how he did ride.
"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! Here's the house ! "
They all at once did cry ;
"The dinner waits, and we are tired ;"
Said Gilpin, "So am I ! "
But yet his horse was not a whit Inclined to tarry there ;
For why ? his owner had a house Full ten miles off, at Ware.

JOHN GILPIN
So like an arrow swift he flew,
Shot by an archer strong;
So did he fly-which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Awaywent Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the Calender's
His horse at last stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbor in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him.
"What news? what news? your tidings tell !
Tell me you must and shallSay, why bare-headed you are come,
Orwhy you come at all?"
NowGilpin had apleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke;
And thus unto the Calender
In merry guise he spoke :
"I came, because your horse would come;
And, if I well forbode,
Myhat and wig will soon be here,
They are uponthe road."
The Calender, right glad to find His friend in merry pin,
Return'd him not asingle word,
But to the house went in;

JOHN GILPIN
Whence straight he came, with hat and wig,
Awig that flow'd behind ;
Ahat not much the worse for wear;
Each comely in its kind.
He held them up, and in his turn Thus show'd his ready wit :
"My head is twice as big as yours,
They therefore needs must fit.
"But let me scrape the dirt away,
That hangs upon your face;
And stop and eat, for well you may Be in ahungry case."
Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
And all the world would stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton,
And I should dine at Ware!"
So, turning to his horse, he said,
"I am in haste to dine;
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
You shall goback for mine."
Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!
For which he paid full dear;
For, while he spake, abraying ass Did sing most loud and clear;
Whereat his horse did snort, as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And ' gallop'd off with all his might,
Ashe had done before.

JOHN GILPIN
Awaywent Gilpin, and away Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
He lost them sooner than at first,
For why?-they were too big.
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw Her husband posting down Into the country far away,
She pull'd out half-a-crown ;
And thus unto the youth she said,
That drove them to the Bell,
"This shall be yours, when you bring back My husband safe and well. "
The youth did ride, and soon did meet John coming back amain;
