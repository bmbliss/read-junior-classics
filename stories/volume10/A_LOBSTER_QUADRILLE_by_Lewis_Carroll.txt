"WILLyouwalkalittle faster?" said awhit-
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's tread- ing on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won'tyou, won't you join the dance?
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
Whenthey take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askanceSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

would not join the dance.

"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied,
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to FranceThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and jointhe dance.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?" ..
