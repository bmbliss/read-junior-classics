THERE was pretty chicken, once a
But his friends were very few,
For he thought that there was nothing In the world but what he knew.
So he always in the farmyard Had a very forward way,

Telling all the hens and turkeys What they ought to do and say. "Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder That your goslings you should let
Go out paddling in the water
;
It will kill them to get wet.
"
"And
I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,"
Hebegan to her one day
,
"That you wouldn't sit all summer
In your nest uponthe hay
;
Won't you come out to the meadow,
Where the grass with seeds is filled?" "If I should," said Mrs. Dorking, " Then my eggs would get all chilled." "No, they won't," replied the chicken; "And no matter if they do.
Eggs are really good for nothing.
What's an egg to me or you
?"
"What's an egg?" said Mrs. Dorking
.
Andif kind wings had not warmed you, "Can it be you do not know?
You yourself were in an eggshell Just a little month agoYou would not be out to-day,
Telling hens
, and geese, and turkeys
What they ought to do or say
!
"
To be very wise and show it,
Is
apleasant thing
, no doubt
;
Butwhenyoung folks talk to old folks,
They should know what they're about
.
