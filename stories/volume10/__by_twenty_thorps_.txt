a little town,
And half
a hundred bridges
.
Till last by Philip's farm
I flow To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
I chatter over stony ways
,
In little sharps and trebles,
I bubble into eddying bays
,
I babble on the pebbles
.
With many
a curve my banks
