O sea, to sea! The calm is o'er;
The wanton water leaps in sport,
And rattles down the pebbly shore ;
The dolphin wheels, the sea cows snort,
Andunseen mermaids' pearly song
Comes bubbling up, the weeds among.
Fling broad the sail, dip deep the oar:
To sea, to sea! the calm is o'er.
To sea, to sea! our wide-winged bark Shall billowy cleave its sunny way,
And with its shadow, fleet and dark,
Break the caved Triton's azure day,
THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
Like mighty eagle soaring light
O'er antelopes on Alpine height.
The anchor heaves, the ship swings free,
The sails swell full. To sea, to sea!
