AM coming, I am coming! Hark! the little bee is humming; See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky; And the gnats are on the wing, Wheeling round in airy ring. See the yellow catkins cover All the slender willows over ! And on the banks of mossy green Star-like primroses are seen; And, their clustering leaves below, White and purple violets blow. Hark! the new-born lambs are bleating, Andthe cawing rooks are meeting In the elms a noisy crowd; All the birds are singing loud ; And the first white butterfly Inthe sunshine dances by. GREEN THINGS GROWING Look around thee, look around! Flowers in all the fields abound: Every running stream is bright ; All the orchard trees are white; And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit. Turn thine eyes to earth and heaven: God for thee the spring has given, Taught the birds their melodies, Clothed the earth and cleared the skies For thy pleasure or thy food; Pour thy soul in gratitude.
