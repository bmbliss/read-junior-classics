So far and fast to-day; ran The birds are weary, for who sang So many songs as they? The bees and butterflies at last Are tired out, for just think, too, Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through, And so, as all tired people do, They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds. The sun has shut his golden eye And gone to sleep beneath the sky, The birds and butterflies and bees Have all crept into flowers and trees, And all lie quiet, still as mice, Till morning comes-like father's voice. So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP! Must sleep away till morning, too. Close little eyes, down little heads, And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.
