S soon as the fire burns red and low
Andthe house upstairs is still,
She sings me a queer little sleepy song,
Of sheep that go over the hill.
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
Their colors are gray and white;
They follow their leader nose and tail,
For they must be home by night.
Andone slips over, and one comes next,
Andone runs after behind;
The gray one's nose at the white one's tail,
The top of the hill they find.


Andwhen they get to the top of the hill
They quietly slip away,
But one runs over, and one comes next,
Their colors are white and gray.
And over they go, and over they go,
And over the top of the hill
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
And the house upstairs is still.
And one slips over, and one comes next,
The good little, gray little sheep !
Iwatchhow the fire burns red and low,
Andshe says that I fall asleep.
T
TWENTY FROGGIES
ByGeorge Cooper
WENTY froggies went to school,
Down beside a rushy pool,
Twenty little coats of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
"We must be in time," said they, ...
"First we study, then we play;
That is how we keep the rule,
When we froggies go to school."
Master Bull-frog, brave and stern,
Called his classes in their turn,
Taught them how to nobly strive,
Alsohow to leap and dive;


Taught them how to dodge a blow,
From the sticks that bad boys throw.
Twenty froggies grew up fast,
Bull-frogs they became at last ;
Polished in a high degree,
As each froggie ought to be,
Now they sit on other logs,
Teaching other little frogs.
