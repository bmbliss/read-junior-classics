They enter my castle wall.
They climb up into my turret,
O'er the arms and back of my chair;
If I try to escape, they surround me:
They seem to be everywhere.
They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me intwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
In his Mouse- Tower on the Rhine.
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old mustache as I am
Is not a match for you all?
I have you fast in my fortress,
Andwill not let you depart,
But put you into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart.

SMALL AND EARLY
And there will I keep you forever,
Yes, forever and aday,
Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
Andmoulder in dust away.
