LADYThe-BIRD field-mouse !lady-has birdgone ! fly awayherhome nest,: The daisies have shut up their sleepy red eyes, And the bees and the birds are at rest. Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away home: The glow-worm is lighting her lamp, The dew's falling fast, and your fine speckled wings Will flag with the close-clinging damp. GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET Lady-bird ! lady-bird ! fly away home- Good luck if you reach it at last ! The owl's come abroad, and the bat's on the roam, Sharp set from their Ramazan fast. Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeThe fairy bells tinkle afar ! Make haste, or they'll catch you, and harness you fast With a cobweb to Oberon's car. Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeTo your house in the old willow-tree, Where your children so dear have invited the ant And a few cosy neighbors to tea. Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away home, And if not gobbled up by the way, Nor yoked by the fairies to Oberon's car, You're in luck-and that's all I've to say.
