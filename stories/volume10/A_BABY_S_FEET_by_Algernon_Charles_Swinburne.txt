BABY'S feet, like sea shells pink,
Might tempt, should heaven see meet,
An angel's lips to kiss, we thinkAbaby's feet.
Like rose-hued sea flowers toward the heat
They stretch and spread and wink Their ten soft buds that part and meet.


No flower bells that expand and shrink Gleamhalf so heavenly sweet,
As shine on life's untrodden brinkAbaby's feet.
