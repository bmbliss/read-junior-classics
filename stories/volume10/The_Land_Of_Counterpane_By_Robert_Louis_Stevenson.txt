WHEN I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
Andall my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills ;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up anddown among the sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
Andsees before him, dale andplain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.
