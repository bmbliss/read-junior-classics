Bells, bells, bellsIn the clamor and the clangor of the bells.
Hear the tolling of the bells- Iron bells !
What a world of solemn thought their monody
compels !
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone !
For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people-ah, the people- They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stoneThey are neither man nor woman- They are neither brute nor human- They are Ghouls :


And their king it is that tolls ;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
Rolls
Apæan from the bells !
And his merry bosom swells With the pæan of the bells !
And he dances and he yells ;
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pean of the bells- Of the bells :
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the sobbing of the bells,
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In ahappy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells- Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
