AID The Raggedy Man, on a hot afternoon: SAID"MyTH!
Sakes!
What a lot o' mistakes
Some little folks makes on The Man in the Moon!
But people that's be'n to see him, like me,
And calls on him frequent and intimuttiy,
Might drop a few facts that would interest you Clean!
Through !-
If you wanted 'em toSome actual facts that might interest you!



"O The Man in the Moon has a crick in his back;
Whee!
Whimm!
Ain't you sorry for him?
Andamole onhis nose that is purple and black;
And his eyes are so weak that they water and run
If he dares to dream even he looks at the sunSo he jes dreams of stars, as the doctors advise- My!
Eyes !
But isn't he wiseTo jes dream of stars, as the doctors advise?
"And The Man in the Moonhas aboil on his earWhee!
Whing!
What a singular thing!
Iknow! but these facts are authentic, mydear- There's a boil onhis ear; and a corn on his chinHe calls it a dimple-but dimples stick in; -
Yet it might be a dimple turned over, you know!
Whang!
Ho!
Why, certainly so!-
It might be a dimple turned over, you know!
"And The Manin the Moon has a rheumatic kneeGee!
Whizz!
What a pity that is!
And his toes have worked round where his heels
ought to be.—
So whenever he wants to go north he goes south,



And comes back with porridge-crumbs all round his mouth,
Andhe brushes them off with a Japanese fan,
Whing!
Whann!
What a marvellous man!
What a very remarkably marvellous man!
"And The Manin the Moon," sighed The Raggedy Man,
"Gits!
So!
Sullonesome, you know- Up there by hisse'f sence creation began!
That when I call on him and then come away,
Hegrabs me and holds me and begs me to stay- Till-Well! if it wasn't fer Jimmy-cum-jim,
Dadd!
Limb!
I'd go pardners with him- Jes jump my job here and be pardners with him!"
