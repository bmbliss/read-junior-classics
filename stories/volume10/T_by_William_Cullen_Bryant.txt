HOU blossom, bright with autumn dew,
Andcolored with the heaven's own blue,
That openest when the quiet light
Succeeds the keen and frosty night,
Thou comest not when violets lean
O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
Or columbines, in purple dressed,
Nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest.


Thou waitest late, and com'st alone,
When woods are bare and birds are flown,
Andfrosts and shortening days portend
The aged Year is near his end.
Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
Look through its fringes to the sky,
Blue-blue-as if that sky let fall
Aflower from its cerulean wall.
I would that thus, when I shall see
The hour of death draw near to me,
Hope, blossoming within my heart,
May look to heaven as I depart.
SUMMER DAYS
Anonymous
INTER is cold-hearted;
Autumn is a weathercock;
Blown every way:
Summer days for me
When every leaf is on its tree,
When Robin's not a beggar,
And Jenny Wren's a bride,
And larks hang, singing, singing, singing,
Over the wheat-fields wide,
And anchored lilies ride,
And the pendulum spider Swings from side to side.


And blue-black beetles transact business,
And gnats fly in ahost And furry caterpillars hasten
That no time be lost,
Andmoths grow fat and thrive,
And lady birds arrive.
Before green apples blush,
Before green nuts embrown,
Why, one day in the country
Is worth a month in townIs worth a day and ayear
Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion That days drone elsewhere.
