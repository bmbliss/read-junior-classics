VOICE resounds like thunder peal,
'Middashingwaveandclang ofsteel;
"The Rhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine!
Who guards to-day my stream divine?"
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine,
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine ;
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine,
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch
the Rhine.

THE WATCH ON THE RHINE
They stand a hundred thousand strong,
Quick to avenge their country's wrong;
With filial love their bosoms swell;
They'll guard the sacred land-mark well.
Dear Fatherland! nodanger thine,
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine ;
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch
the Rhine,
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine.
While flows one drop of Germanblood,
Or sword remains to guard thy flood,
While rifle rests in patriot's hand,
No foe shall tread thy sacred strand!
Dear Fatherland ! nodanger thine,
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine ;
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine,
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine.
Our oath resounds, the river flows,
In golden light our banner glows,
Ourhearts will guard thy stream divine,
TheRhine, the Rhine, the German Rhine.
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine,
Dear Fatherland! no danger thine ;
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine,
Firm stand thy sons to watch, to watch the Rhine.
