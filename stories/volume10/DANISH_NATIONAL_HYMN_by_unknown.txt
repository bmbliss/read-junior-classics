KING Christian stood by lofty mast,
In mist and smoke.
His sword was hammering so fast,
Thro' Gothic helm and brain it pass'd,
Then sank each hostile hulk and mast,
In mist and smoke.
"Fly," shouted they; "fly he who can!
Who braves of Denmark's Christian,
Who braves of Denmark's Christian the stroke."
Nils Juel gave heed to th' tempest's roar,
Now is the hour!
He hoisted his blood-red flag once more,
And smote upon the foe full sore,
Andshouted loud thro' the tempest's roar,
"Now is the hour."
"Fly!" shouted they, "for shelter fly !
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy,
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy the power?"
North Sea! aglimpse of Wessel rent
Thy murky sky !
Then champions to thine arms were sent;
Terror and Death glared where he went;
From the waves was heard a wail, that rent
Thy murky sky !
From Denmark thunders Tordenskiol!
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul,
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul andfly.
Path of the Dane to fame and might!
Dark rolling wave!
Receive thy friend, who scorning flight,
Goes to meet danger with despite,
Proudly as thou the tempest's might,
Dark rolling wave!
'Mid mingled pleasures and alarms,
Andwar and vict'ry be thine arms,
'Midwar and vict'ry, be thine arms mygrave.
