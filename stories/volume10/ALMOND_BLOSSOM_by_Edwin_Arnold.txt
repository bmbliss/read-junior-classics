BLOSSOM of the LOSSOM of the almond-trees,
April's gift to April's bees,
Birthday ornament of spring,
Flora's fairest daughterling;-
Coming when no flowerets dare
Trust the cruel outer air,
When the royal king-cup bold
Dares not donhis coat of gold,


And the sturdy blackthorn spray
Keeps his silver for the May;-
Coming when no flowerets would,
Save thy lowly sisterhood,
Early violets, blue and white,
Dying for their love of light.
Almond blossom, sent to teach us
That the spring days soon will reach us,
Lest, with longing over-tried,
We die as the violets diedBlossom, clouding all the tree With thy crimson broidery,
Long before a leaf of green On the bravest bough is seenAh! when winter winds are swinging
All thy red bells into ringing,
With a bee in every bell,
Almond bloom, we greet thee well.
I
