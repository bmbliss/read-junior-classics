HERE was a sound of revelrybynight,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.
Athousand hearts beat happily; and when Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell :
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising
knell!
Didye not hear it? No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.
Onwith the dance! let joy be unconfined!
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure
meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet !
But hark ! that heavy sound breaks in once
more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before!
Arm! arm! it is it is the cannon's opening roar!


Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago,
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness ;
And there were sudden partings, such as press The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn
could rise?
And there was mounting inhot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering
car
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
Andswiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
Andnear, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star ;
While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips, "The foe! They come! They come!"
