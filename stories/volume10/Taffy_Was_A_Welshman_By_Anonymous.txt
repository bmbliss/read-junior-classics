TAFFY was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief; Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not at home; Taffy came to my house and stole amarrow-bone. I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not in; Taffy came to my house and stole a silver pin; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed, I took up a poker and flung it at his head.
