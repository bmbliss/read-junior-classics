KNOW the song that the bluebird is singing,
Out in the apple-tree where he is swinging,
Brave little fellow ! the skies may be drearyNothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.
Hark! how the music leaps out from his throat !
Hark! was there ever so merry a note?
Listen awhile, and you'll hear what he's saying,
Up in the apple-tree swinging and swaying :
"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,
You must be weary of winter, I know;
Hark while I sing you a message of cheer:
Summer is coming! and spring-time is here!

THE NIGHTINGALE
"Little white snow-drop! I pray you arise ;
Bright yellow crocus! come, open your eyes ;
Sweet little violets, hid from the cold,
Put on your mantles of purple and gold;
Daffodils ! daffodils! say, do you hear ?-
Summer is coming! and spring-time is here!"
THE NIGHTINGALE AND
GLOW- WORM
