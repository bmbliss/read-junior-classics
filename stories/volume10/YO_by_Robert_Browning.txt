OU know, we French stormed Ratisbon
Amile or so away,
On a little mound, Napoleon Stood on our storming-day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow Oppressive with its mind.

THE FRENCH CAMP
Just as perhaps he mused "My plans That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes Waver at yonder wall"-
Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew Arider, bound on bound
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew Until he reached the mound.
Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
Byjust his horse's mane, a boy:
You hardly could suspect- (So tight he kept his lips compressed,
Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
Was all but shot in two.
"Well, " cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace We've got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon To see your flag-bird flap his vans Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him! " The chief's eye flashed; his
plans Soared up again like fire.
The chief's eye flashed; but presently Softened itself, as sheathes
Afilm the mother-eagle's eye When her bruised eaglet breathes ;

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
"You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride Touched to the quick, he said :
"I'm killed, Sire !" And his chief beside
Smiling the boy fell dead.
