Howdo youlik OWdo you like to go up in aswing, Upin the air so blue? Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing Ever a child can do! Up in the air and over the wall, Till I can see so wide, Rivers and trees and cattle and all Over the countryside90 THE LAMPLIGHTER Till I look down onthe garden green, Down on the roof so brownUp in the air I go flying again, Up in the air and down!
