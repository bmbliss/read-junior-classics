Howdo youlik OWdo you like to go up in aswing,
Upin the air so blue?
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing Ever a child can do!
Up in the air and over the wall,
Till I can see so wide,
Rivers and trees and cattle and all
Over the countryside90
THE LAMPLIGHTER
Till I look down onthe garden green,
Down on the roof so brownUp in the air I go flying again,
Up in the air and down!
