T was awful long ago That I put those seeds around; And I guess I ought to know When I stuck 'em in the ground. 'Cause I noted down the day In a little diary book- It's gotten losted somewheres, and I don't know where to look. But I'm certain anyhow, They've been planted 'most a week; And it must be time by now For their little sprouts to peek. They've been watered every day With a very speshul care, And once or twice I've dug 'em up, to See if they was there. Ifixed the dirt in humps, Just the way they said I should; And I crumbled all the lumps Just as finely as I could. WISHING And I found an angle-worm A-poking up his headHe maybe feeds on seeds and such, And so I squashed him dead. A seed's so very small ; And dirt all looks the sameHow can they know at all The way they ought to aim? And so I'm waiting 'round In case of any need; Afarmer ought to do his best for Every single seed!
