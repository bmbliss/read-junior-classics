WOODMAN,aspare singlethat boughtree!
In youth it sheltered me,
And I'll protect it now.
'Twas my forefather's hand That placed it near his cot;
There, woodman, let it stand,
Thy ax shall harm it not.
That old familiar tree,
Whose glory and renown
Are spread o'er land and sea- And wouldst thou hew it down?
:


Woodman, forbear thy stroke !
Cut not its earth-bound ties ;
Oh, spare that aged oak Now towering to the skies !
Whenbut an idle boy,
I sought its grateful shade ;
In all their gushing joy Here, too, my sisters played.
My mother kissed me here ;
My father pressed my hand- Forgive this foolish tear,
But let that old oak stand.
My heart-strings round thee cling,
Close as thy bark, old friend !
Here shall the wild-bird sing,
And still thy branches bend.
Old tree! the storm still brave !
And, woodman, leave the spot ;
While I've a hand to save,
Thy ax shall harm it not.
