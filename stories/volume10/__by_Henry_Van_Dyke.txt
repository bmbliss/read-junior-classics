WHO will walk amile with me
Along life's merry way?
Acomrade blithe and full of glee,
Who dares to laugh out loud and free,
And let his frolic fancy play,
Like ahappy child, through the flowers gay
That fill the field and fringe the way
Where he walks a mile with me.
And who will walk a mile with me
Along life's weary way?
Afriend whose heart has eyes to see
The stars shine out o'er the darkening lea,
Andthe quiet rest at the end o' the dayA friend who knows and dares to say,
The brave, sweet words that cheer the way
Where he walks a mile with me.

THE ARROW AND THE SONG
With such a comrade, such a friend,
I fain would walk till journey's end,
Through summer sunshine, winter rain,
Andthen?-Farewell, we shall meet again!
