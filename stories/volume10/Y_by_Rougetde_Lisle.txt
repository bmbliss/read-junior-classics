Esons of freedom, wake to glory !
Hark! hark ! what myriads bid you rise !
Your childen, wives, and grandsires hoary,
Behold their tears and hear their cries !
Shall hateful tyrants, mischiefs breeding,
With hireling hosts, a ruffian band,
Affright and desolate the land,
While peace and liberty lie bleeding?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! all hearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling,
Which treacherous kings confederate raise ;
The dogs of war, let loose, are howling,
And lo! our fields and cities blaze;
And shall we basely view the ruin,
While lawless force, with guilty stride,
Spreads desolation far and wide,
With crimes and blood his hands embruing?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! allhearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
O Liberty! can man resign thee,
Once having felt thy generous flame?
Candungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee?
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?

NATIONAL HYMN OF NORWAY
Too long the world has wept, bewailing That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield,
But freedom is our sword and shield,
And all their arts are unavailing.
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe ;
March on! march on! all hearts resolved
Onvictory or death.

DANISH NATIONAL HYMN
K
ING Christian stood by lofty mast,
In mist and smoke.
His sword was hammering so fast,
Thro' Gothic helm and brain it pass'd,
Then sank each hostile hulk and mast,
In mist and smoke.
"Fly," shouted they; "fly he who can!
Who braves of Denmark's Christian,
Who braves of Denmark's Christian the
stroke."
Nils Juel gave heed to th' tempest's roar,
Now is the hour!
He hoisted his blood-red flag once more,
And smote upon the foe full sore,
Andshouted loud thro' the tempest's roar,
"Now is the hour."
"Fly!" shouted they, "for shelter fly !
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy,
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy the power?"

SPANISH NATIONAL HYMN
North Sea! aglimpse of Wessel rent
Thy murky sky !
Then champions to thine arms were sent;
Terror and Death glared where he went;
From the waves was heard a wail, that rent
Thy murky sky !
From Denmark thunders Tordenskiol!
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul,
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul andfly.
Path of the Dane to fame and might!
Dark rolling wave!
Receive thy friend, who scorning flight,
Goes to meet danger with despite,
Proudly as thou the tempest's might,
Dark rolling wave!
'Mid mingled pleasures and alarms,
Andwar and vict'ry be thine arms,
'Midwar and vict'ry, be thine arms mygrave.

Till the laurel crown'd, a victor,
All hearts bow at thy command.

Thus we sing, and thus we pray.
