Yfairest child, I have no song to give you ; No lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray; Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you For every day. Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever; Do noble things, not dream them all day long: Andso make life, death, and that vast forever One grand, sweet song.
