CHE winds, as at their hour of birth,
Leaning upon the ridged sea,
Breathed low around the rolling earth
With the mellow preludes, "We are free,"
The streams through many a lilied row
Down-carolling to the crisped sea,
Low-tinkled with abell-like flow
Atween the blossoms, "We are free."
THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
