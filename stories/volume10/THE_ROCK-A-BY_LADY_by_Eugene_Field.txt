THE Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street Comes stealing; comes creeping;
The poppies they hang from her head to her
feet,
And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleetShe bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
When she findeth you sleeping!
There is one little dream of a beautiful drum-
"Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
There is one little dream of abig sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that bloweth !
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing;
Andboats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams,
And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!


Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny
and fleet?
They'll come to you sleeping;
So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street,
With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
Comes stealing; comes creeping.
