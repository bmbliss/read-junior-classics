HE Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street Comes stealing; comes creeping;
The poppies they hang from her head to her
feet,
And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleetShe bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
When she findeth you sleeping!
There is one little dream of a beautiful drum-
"Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
There is one little dream of abig sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that bloweth !
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing;
Andboats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams,
And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!


Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny
and fleet?
They'll come to you sleeping;
So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street,
With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
Comes stealing; comes creeping.

THE NEW MOON
Anonymous
EAR mother, how pretty The moon looks to-night!
She was never so cunning before;
Her two little horns
Are so sharp and so bright,
Ihope she'll not grow any more.
If I were up there,
With you and my friends,
I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;
I'd sit in the middle
Andhold by both ends ;
Oh, what abright cradle 'twould be!
Iwould call to the stars
To keep out of the way,
Lest we should rock over their toes ;
And then I would rock
Till the dawn of the day,
And see where the pretty moon goes.


And there we would stay
In the beautiful skies,
And through the bright clouds we would roam We would see the sun set,
And see the sun rise,
And on the next rainbow come home.
