LIKE little Pussy, her coat is so warm,
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm;
So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
ButPussy and I very gently will play;
She shall sit by my side, and I'll give her some
food;
And she'll love me, because I am gentle and good.
I'll pat little Pussy, and then she will purr,
Andthus show her thanks for my kindness to her;
I'll not pinch her ears, nor tread on her paw,
Lest I should provoke her to use her sharp claw;
I never will vex her, nor make her displeased,
For Pussy don't like to be worried or teased.
