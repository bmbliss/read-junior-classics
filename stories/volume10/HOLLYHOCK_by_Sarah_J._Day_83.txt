HE stately Lady Hollyhock
Has graced my garden-bed for years,
Sedately stiffened in a frock
All frills and ruffles to her ears ;
For at the fashions one may mock
When one is born a Hollyhock.
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Her gay companions creep and twine And riot in the summer breeze ;
But she doth haughtily decline To join in common sports like these ;
Such indecorum needs must shock
Awell-bred, well-starched Hollyhock.
