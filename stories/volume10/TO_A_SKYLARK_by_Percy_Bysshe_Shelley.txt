HAILBirdto theenever , blithe spirit !
That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

TO A SKYLARK
Higher still and higher From the earth thou springest:
Like a cloud of fire,
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,
Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight,
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delightKeen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere
Whose intense lamp narrows In the white dawn clear,
Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.
All the earth and air
With they voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd.

TO A SKYLARK
What thou art we know not ;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see As from thy presence showers arain of melody:-
Like a poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like ahigh-born maiden
In a palace tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love which overflows her
bower:
Like a glow-worm golden In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aÃ«rial hue
Among the flowers and grass which screen it from
the view:
Like a rose embowered
