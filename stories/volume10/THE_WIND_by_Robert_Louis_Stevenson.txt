SAWyou toss the kites on high Andblow the birds about the sky ;
And all around I heard you pass,
Like ladies' skirts across the grassOwind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!
I saw the different things you did,
But always you yourself you hid.
I felt you push, I heard you call,
Icould not see yourself at all- Owind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!

WIND-SONG
O you that are so strong and cold,
O blower are you young or old?
Are you a beast of field and tree,
Or just a stronger child than me?
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud a song!
WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND
