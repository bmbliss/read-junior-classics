IVE every man thy ear, but few thy voice :
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
OVER HILL, OVER DALE
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all : to thine own self be true ;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
-From "Hamlet."
