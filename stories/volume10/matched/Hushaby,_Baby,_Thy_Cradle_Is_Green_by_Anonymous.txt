HUSHABY, baby, thy cradle is green;
Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
Sister's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
Brother's a drummer, and drums for the king.
Rockabye, baby, on the tree top ;
When the wind blows the cradle will rock ;
Whenthe bough breaks the cradle will fall ;
Downwill come baby, bough, cradle, and all.
