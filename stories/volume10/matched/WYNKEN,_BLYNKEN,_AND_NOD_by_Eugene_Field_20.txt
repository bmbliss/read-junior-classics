YNKEN, Blynken, and Nodonenight Sailed off in awooden shoeSailed on a river of crystal light,
Into a sea of dew.
"Where are yougoing, and what doyou wish?"
The old moon asked the three.
WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD
"Wehave come to fish for the herring fish That live in this beautiful sea ;
Nets of silver and gold have we ! "
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish That lived in that beautiful sea-
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish- Never afeard are we " ;
So cried the stars to the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
All night long their nets they threw To the stars in the twinkling foamThen down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home ;
'Twas all so pretty a sail it seemed As if it could not be,
And some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd
dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful seaBut I shall name you the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
CUDDLE DOWN, DOLLY
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed.
So shut your eyes while mother sings
Ofwonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things As you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken.
AndNod.
