ABY Bye,
Here's a fly;
Let us watch him, you and I.. How he crawls
Up the walls,
Yet he never falls !
I believe with six such legs
You and I could walk on eggs.
BABY BYE
There he goes
On his toes,
Tickling Baby's nose.
Spots of red
Dot his head;
Rainbows on his back are spread;
That small speck Is his neck;
See him nod and beck.
I can show you, if you choose,
Where to look to find his shoesThree small pairs,
Made of hairs ;
These he always wears.
Black and brown
Is his gown;
He can wear it upside down;
Itis laced
Round his waist;
I admire his taste.
Yet though tight his clothes are made,
He will lose them, I'm afraid,
If to-night
He gets sight
Of the candle-light.
Inthe sun
Webs are spun;
What if he gets into one?
When it rains
Hecomplains
Onthe window-panes.
BABY BYE
Tongue to talk have you and I;
God has given the little fly No such things,
Sohe sings
Withhis buzzingwings.
He can eat
Bread and meat;
There's his mouth between his feet.
Onhis back
Is a pack Like apeddler's sack Does the baby understand?
Then the fly shall kiss her hand;
Put a crumb
Onher thumb,
Maybe he will come.
Catch him? No,
Lethim go,
Never hurt an insect so;
But no doubt
He flies out
Just to gad about.
Nowyou see his wings of silk Drabbled in the baby's milk;
Fie, Ofie,
Foolish fly!
How will he get dry?.
All wet flies
Twist their thighs ;
Thus they wipe their heads and eyes;
Cats you know,
Wash just so,
Then their whiskers grow.
Flies have hairs too short to comb,
So they fly bareheaded home;
But the gnat Wears a hat
Do you believe that?
Flies can see
More than we,
So how bright their eyes must be!
Little fly,
Ope your eye;
Spiders are near by.
For a secret I can tell,
Spiders never use flies well.
Then away
Do not stay,
Little fly, good day.
