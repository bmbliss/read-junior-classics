ALL forward! All forward! All forward to battle! the trumpets are crying, All forward! All forward! our old flag is flying, When Liberty calls us we linger no longer ; Rebels, come on! tho' a thousand to one! Liberty! Liberty! deathless and glorious, Under thy banner thy sons are victorious, Free souls are valiant, and strong arms are stronger, Godshall go with us, and battle be won. Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free. All forward! All forward! All forward for Freedom! In terrible splendor She comes to the loyal who die to defend her ; Her stars and stripes o'er the wild wave of battle Shall float in the heavens to welcome us on. All forward! to glory, thro' life-blood is pouring, Where bright swords are flashing, and cannons are roaring, Welcome to death in the bullet's quick rattle, Fighting or falling shall freedom be won. Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner ! Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free. All forward! All forward! All forward to conquer! Where free hearts are beating, Death to the cowardwho dreams of retreating! Liberty calls us from mountain and valley; Waving her banner she leads to the fight. Forward! all forward! the trumpets are crying ; The drum beats to arms, our old flag is flying ; Stout hearts and strong hands around it shall rally, Forward to battle, for God and the Right. Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free.
