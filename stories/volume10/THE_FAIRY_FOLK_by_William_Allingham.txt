UPP the airy mountain,
Down the rushy glen,
We daren't go a-hunting,
For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together ;
Green jacket, red cap,
Andwhite owl's feather.
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home,
They live on crispy pancakes
Of yellow tide-foam;
Some in the reeds
Of the black mountain-lake,
With frogs for their watch-dogs,
All night awake.
High on the hill-top The old King sits ;
He is now so old and gray He's nigh lost his wits.


With
a bridge of white mist Columbkill he crosses,
Onhis stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses
;
Or going up with music
,
On cold starry nights
,
To sup with the Queen
Of the gay Northern Lights
.
They stole little Bridget For seven years long;
When she came down again
Her friends were all gone.
They took her lightly back Between the night and morrow
;
They thought that she was fast asleep
,
But she was dead with sorrow
.
They have kept her ever since
Deep within the lakes
,
On
abed of flag leaves
,
