JACK and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
AndJill came tumbling after.
LITTLE Polly Flinders
Sat among the cinders,
Warming her pretty little toes.
Her mother came and caught her,
Andwhipped her little daughter
For spoiling her nice newclothes.
To market, to market, to buy afat pig;
Home again, home again, dancing ajig
Ride to the market to buy a fat hog ;
Homeagain, home again, jiggety-jog.
