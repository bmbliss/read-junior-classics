HUSHABY, baby, thy cradle is green; Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen; Sister's a lady, and wears a gold ring; Brother's a drummer, and drums for the king. Rockabye, baby, on the tree top ; When the wind blows the cradle will rock ; Whenthe bough breaks the cradle will fall ; Downwill come baby, bough, cradle, and all.
