REEN little vaulter in the sunny grass, Catching your heart up at the feel of June Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon Wheneven the bees lag at the summoning brass ; And you, warm little housekeeper, who class With those who think the candles come too soon, Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune Nick the glad silent moments as they pass ! ANT AND CRICKET O sweet and tiny cousins, that belong, One to the fields, the other to the hearth, Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are strong At your clear hearts ; and both seem given to earth To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song- In doors and out, summer and winter, mirth.
