she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go
to market, and buy a little pig."
As she was coming home, she came to a stile ;
but the pig would not go over the stile.
She went a little further, and she met adog. So she said to the dog-
"Dog, dog, bite pig!
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."

The stick began to beat the dog;
The dog began to bite the pig ;
The pig jumped over the stile,
And so the old woman got home that night.

Pussy
By Jane Taylor

LIKE little Pussy, her coat is so warm,
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm;
So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
ButPussy and I very gently will play;
She shall sit by my side, and I'll give her some
food;
And she'll love me, because I am gentle and good.
I'll pat little Pussy, and then she will purr,
Andthus show her thanks for my kindness to her;
I'll not pinch her ears, nor tread on her paw,
Lest I should provoke her to use her sharp claw;
I never will vex her, nor make her displeased,
For Pussy don't like to be worried or teased.

The Sleepy Song
By Josephine Daskam Bacon

S soon as the fire burns red and low
Andthe house upstairs is still,
She sings me a queer little sleepy song,
Of sheep that go over the hill.
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
Their colors are gray and white;
They follow their leader nose and tail,
For they must be home by night.
Andone slips over, and one comes next,
Andone runs after behind;
The gray one's nose at the white one's tail,
The top of the hill they find.
41
TWENTY FROGGIES
Andwhen they get to the top of the hill
They quietly slip away,
But one runs over, and one comes next,
Their colors are white and gray.
And over they go, and over they go,
And over the top of the hill
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
And the house upstairs is still.
And one slips over, and one comes next,
The good little, gray little sheep !
Iwatchhow the fire burns red and low,
Andshe says that I fall asleep.

TWENTY FROGGIES
ByGeorge Cooper
WENTY froggies went to school,
Down beside a rushy pool,
Twenty little coats of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
"We must be in time," said they, ...
"First we study, then we play;
That is how we keep the rule,
When we froggies go to school."
Master Bull-frog, brave and stern,
Called his classes in their turn,
Taught them how to nobly strive,
Alsohow to leap and dive;
42
A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
Taught them how to dodge a blow,
From the sticks that bad boys throw.
Twenty froggies grew up fast,
Bull-frogs they became at last ;
Polished in a high degree,
As each froggie ought to be,
Now they sit on other logs,
Teaching other little frogs.

S Even Song
By Richard Le Gallienne

So far and fast to-day;
ran
The birds are weary, for who sang
So many songs as they?
The bees and butterflies at last
Are tired out, for just think, too,
Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through,
And so, as all tired people do,
They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds.
The sun has shut his golden eye
And gone to sleep beneath the sky,
The birds and butterflies and bees
Have all crept into flowers and trees,
And all lie quiet, still as mice,
Till morning comes-like father's voice.
So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you
43
SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!
Must sleep away till morning, too.
Close little eyes, down little heads,
And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.

USH! the waves are rolling in,
White with foam, white with foam;
Father toils amid the din ;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the winds roar hoarse and deepOnthey come, on they come !

But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the rain sweeps o'er the knowes,
Where they roam, where they roam;

Sleep, baby, sleep !
The large stars are the sheep ;
The little stars are the lambs, I guess ;
And the gentle moon is the shepherdess.

He is the Lamb of God on high,
Who for our sakes came down to die.
Sleep, baby, sleep!

Eyes
By Eugene Field

WHENAnd mytheweary busyday littleisone done,
Rocketh gently to and fro ;
When the night winds softly blow,
And the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again;
When upon the haunted green Fairies dance around their queenThen from yonder misty skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
:
Through the murk and mist and gloam
To our quiet, cosy home,
Where to singing, sweet and low,
Rocks a cradle to and fro ;
Where the clock's dull monotone
Telleth of the day that's done;

LADY BUTTON- EYES
Where the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor- Where my weary wee one lies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Cometh like a fleeting ghost
From some distant eerie coast;
Never footfall can you hear
As that spirit fareth nearNever whisper, never word From that shadow-queen is heard.
In ethereal raiment dight,
From the realm of fay and sprite
In the depth of yonder skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Layeth she her hands upon My dear weary little one,
And those white hands overspread
Like a veil the curly head,
Seem to fondle and caress
Every little silken tress ;
Then she smooths the eyelids down
Over those two eyes of brown- In such soothing, tender wise Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Dearest, feel upon your brow That caressing magic now;
For the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again,
While upon the haunted green
Fairies dance around their queen,

By Lady

HE Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street Comes stealing; comes creeping;
The poppies they hang from her head to her
feet,
And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleetShe bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
When she findeth you sleeping!
There is one little dream of a beautiful drum-
"Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
There is one little dream of abig sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that bloweth !
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing;
Andboats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams,
And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!
47
THE NEW MOON
Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny
and fleet?
They'll come to you sleeping;
So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street,
With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
Comes stealing; comes creeping.

The New Moon
Anonymous

EAR mother, how pretty The moon looks to-night!
She was never so cunning before;
Her two little horns
Are so sharp and so bright,
Ihope she'll not grow any more.
If I were up there,
With you and my friends,
I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;
I'd sit in the middle
Andhold by both ends ;
Oh, what abright cradle 'twould be!
Iwould call to the stars
To keep out of the way,
Lest we should rock over their toes ;
And then I would rock
Till the dawn of the day,
And see where the pretty moon goes.

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
And there we would stay
In the beautiful skies,
And through the bright clouds we would roam We would see the sun set,
And see the sun rise,
And on the next rainbow come home.
THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
W"
By Mary Howitt
ILL you walk into my parlor?"
aspider to a fly;
" Tis the prettiest little parlor That ever you did spy.
The way into my parlor.
Is up a winding stair,
And I have many pretty things To show when you are there."
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"To ask me is in vain;
For who goes up your winding stair Can ne'er come down again."
"I'm sure you must be weary With soaring up so high;
Will you rest upon mylittle bed?"
Said the spider to the fly.
"There are pretty curtains drawn around,
The sheets are fine and thin;
And if you like to rest awhile,
I'll snugly tuck you in. "
49
THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"For I've often heard it said,
They never, never wake again
Who sleep upon your bed."
Said the cunning spider to the fly,
"Dear friend, what shall I do
To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?
I have within my pantry Good store of all that's nice ;
I'm sure you're very welcome- Willyou please to take a slice?"
"Oh, no, no! " said the little fly,
"Kind sir, that cannot be;
I've heard what's in your pantry,
And I do not wish to see."
"Sweet creature," said the spider,
"You're witty and you're wise ;
How handsome are your gauzy wings,
How brilliant are your eyes.
I have a little looking-glass Upon my parlor shelf ;
If you'll step in one moment, dear,
You shall behold yourself."
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,
"For what you're pleased to say,
And bidding you good-morning, now,
I'll call another day."
The spider turned him round about,
And went into his den,
50
THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
For well he knew the silly fly
Would soon be back again;
So he wove a subtle thread
In a little corner sly,
And set his table ready
To dine upon the fly.
Hewent out to his door again,
Andmerrily did sing,
"Come hither, hither, pretty fly,
With the pearl and silver wing;
Your robes are green and purple,
There's a crest upon your head;
Your eyes are like the diamond bright,
But mine are dull as lead."
Alas, alas ! how very soon This silly little fly,
Hearing his wily, flattering words,
Came slowly flitting by:
With buzzing wings she hung aloft,
Then near and nearer drewThought only of her brilliant eyes,
Andgreen and purple hue;
Thought only of her crested head- Poor foolish thing ! At last Upjumped the cunning spider,
And fiercely held her fast.
Hedragged her up his winding stair,
Into his dismal den
Within his little parlor-but
She ne'er came out again!

THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE
AVE you
Tree?
By Eugene Field
ever heard of the Sugar-Plum
'Tis a marvel of great renown!
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea,
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet (As those who have tasted it say)
That good little children have only to eat Of that fruit to be happy next day.
When you've got to the tree, you would have a
hard time
To capture the fruit which I sing;
The tree is so tall that no person could climb
To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,
And agingerbread dog prowls below- And this is the way you contrive to get at Those sugar-plums tempting you so:
52
YOUNG NIGHT- THOUGHT
|
You say but the word to that gingerbread dog And he barks with such terrible zest
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,
As her swelling proportions attest.
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
From this leafy limb unto that,
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground- Hurrah for that chocolate cat !
There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and pepper- mint canes,
With stripings of scarlet or gold,
And you carry away of the treasure that rains As much as your apron can hold !
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me
In your dainty white nightcap and gown,
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.
YOUNG NIGHT-


Thought
By Robert Louis Stevenson

LL night long and every night, AWhenmy mamma puts out the light,
Isee the people marching by,
Asplain as day, before my eye.
Armies and emperors and kings,
All carrying different kinds of things,
Andmarching in so grand away,
You never saw the like by day.
53
LULLABY
So fine a show was never seen
Atthe great circus on the green ;
For every kind of beast and man Is marching in that caravan.
At first they move a little slow,
But still the faster on they go,
And still beside them close I keep
Until we reach the town of Sleep.


Lullaby Of An Infant Chief
By Sir Walter Scott

HUSH thee, my baby, thy sire was aknight,
a lady both lovely and bright;
The woods and the glens from the tower which we
see,
They all are belonging, dear baby, to thee.
O, fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows,
It calls but the warders that guard thy repose ;
Their bows would be bended, their blades would be
red,
Ere the step of a foeman draws near to thy bed.
O, hush thee, my baby, the time will soon come When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you
may,
For strife comes with manhood, and waking with
day.

Sweet And Low
By Alfred Tennyson

WEET and low, sweet and low,
Wind of the western sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow,
Wind of the western sea!
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon and blow,
Blow him again to me;
While my little one, while my pretty one sleeps
Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
Father will come to thee soon;
Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
Father will come to thee soon;
Father will come to his babe in the nest,
Silver sails all out of the west
Under the silver moon:
Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish That lived in that beautiful sea-
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish- Never afeard are we " ;
So cried the stars to the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
All night long their nets they threw To the stars in the twinkling foamThen down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home ;
'Twas all so pretty a sail it seemed As if it could not be,
And some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd
dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful seaBut I shall name you the fishermen three :

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies

And you shall see the beautiful things As you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three :

Amortifying Mistake

STUDIED my tables over and over, and backward and forward too ;
But I couldn't remember six times nine, and I
didn't know what to do,
Till sister told me to play with mydoll, and not to

"If you call her 'Fifty-four' for a while, you'll learn it by heart," she said.
So I took my favorite, Mary Ann (though I
thought ' twas a dreadful shame To give such a perfectly lovely child such a per- fectly horrid name) ,
And I called her my dear little "Fifty-four" a
hundred times, till I knew
The answer of six times nine as well as the answer
of two times two.

Next day Elizabeth Wigglesworth, who always acts so proud,
Said, " Six times nine is fifty-two," and I nearly laughed aloud!
But I wished I hadn't when teacher said, "Now,
Dorothy, tell if you can."
For I thought of my doll and-sakes alive -I!
answered, "Mary Ann! "

Maidenhood
By Henry W. Longfellow

AIDEN! with the meek, brown eyes,
In whose orbs ashadow lies
Like the dusk in evening skies !
Thou whose locks outshine the sun,
Golden tresses, wreathed in one,
As the braided streamlets run!
Standing, with reluctant feet,
Where the brook and river meet,
Womanhood and childhood fleet !
Gazing, with a timid glance,
Onthe brooklet's swift advance,
On the river's broad expanse!
Deep and still, that gliding stream Beautiful to thee must seem,
As the river of adream.
61
MAIDENHOOD
Then why pause with indecision,
When bright angels in thy vision
Beckon thee to fields Elysian?
Seest thou shadows sailing by,
As the dove, with startled eye,
Sees the falcon's shadow fly?
Hearest thou voices on the shore,
That our ears perceive no more,
Deafened by the cataract's roar?
O, thou child of many prayers !
Life hath quicksands-Life hath snares!
Care and age come unawares!
Like the swell of some sweet tune,
Morning rises into noon,
Mayglides onward into June.
Childhood is the bough, where slumbered Birds and blossoms many-numbered;-
Age, that bough with snows encumbered.
Gather, then, each flower that grows,
Whenthe young heart overflows,
To embalm that tent of snows.
Bear a lily in thy hand;
Gates of brass cannot withstand
The touch of that magic wand.
62
WILLIE WINKIE
Bear through sorrow, wrong, and ruth,
In thy heart the dew of youth,
On thy lips the smile of truth.
O, that dew, like balm, shall steal
Into wounds, that cannot heal,
Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;
And that smile, like sunshine, dart
Into many a sunless heart,
For a smile of God thou art. ::

Skirlin' like a kenna-what-wauknin' sleepin' folk.

Ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her

The Giant
By Charles Mackay

HERE came a Giant to my door,
AGiant fierce and strong;
His step was heavy on the floor,
His arms were ten yards long.
He scowled and frowned; he shook the
ground;
I trembled through and through;
At length I looked him in the face And cried, "Who cares for you?"
64
MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
The mighty Giant, as I spoke,
Grewpale and thin and small,
And through his body, as 'twere smoke,
I saw the sunshine fall.
His blood- red eyes turned blue as skies;-
"Is this," I cried, with growing pride,
"Is this the mighty foe?"
:
He sank before my earnest face,
He vanished quite away,
Andleft no shadow inhis place Between me and the day.
Such giants come to strike us dumb,
But, weak in every part,
They melt before the strong man's eyes,
Andfly the true of heart.

HOW THE LEAVES CAME DOWN
"


I
By Susan Coolidge

'LL tell you how the leaves came down,"
The great Tree to his children said:
"You're getting sleepy, Yellow and Brown,
Yes, very sleepy, little Red.
It is quite time to go to bed."
"Ah!" begged each silly, pouting leaf,
"Let us a little longer stay ;
Dear Father Tree, behold our grief!
'Tis such avery pleasant day,
Wedo not want to go away."
So, for just one more merry day To the great Tree the leaflets clung,
Frolicked and danced, and had their way,
Upon the autumn breezes swung,
Whispering all their sports among70
TRY AGAIN
"Perhaps the great Tree will forget,
And let us stay until the spring,
If we all beg, andcoax, and fret."
But the great Tree did no such thing;
He smiled to hear their whispering.
"Come, children, all to bed," he cried;
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer,
He shook his head, and far and wide,
Fluttering and rustling everywhere,
Down sped the leaflets through the air.
I saw them; on the ground they lay,
Golden and red, ahuddled swarm,
Waiting till one from far away,
White bedclothes heaped uponher arm,
Should come to wrap them safe and warm.
The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.
"Good-night, dear little leaves," he said.
And from below each sleepy child Replied, "Good-night," and murmured,
"It is so nice to go to bed!"

Far or near;

Moonshine rays,

BABY BYE
Drooping, sinking, failing,
Nigh to earth,
Mounting, whirling, sailing,
Full of mirth ;
Life there, welling, flowing,
Waving round ;
Pictures coming, going,
Without sound.
Quick now, be this airy
Globe repell'd!
Never can the fairy Star be held.
Touch'd-it in a twinkle
Disappears!
Leaving but a sprinkle,
As of tears.


Baby Bye
By Theodore Tilton

ABY Bye,
Here's a fly;
Let us watch him, you and I.. How he crawls
Up the walls,
Yet he never falls !
I believe with six such legs
You and I could walk on eggs.
73
BABY BYE
There he goes
On his toes,
Tickling Baby's nose.
Spots of red
Dot his head;
Rainbows on his back are spread;
That small speck Is his neck;
See him nod and beck.
I can show you, if you choose,
Where to look to find his shoesThree small pairs,
Made of hairs ;
These he always wears.
Black and brown
Is his gown;
He can wear it upside down;
Itis laced
Round his waist;
I admire his taste.
Yet though tight his clothes are made,
He will lose them, I'm afraid,
If to-night
He gets sight
Of the candle-light.
Inthe sun
Webs are spun;
What if he gets into one?
When it rains
Hecomplains
Onthe window-panes.

Tongue to talk have you and I;
God has given the little fly No such things,
Sohe sings
Withhis buzzingwings.
He can eat
Bread and meat;
There's his mouth between his feet.
Onhis back
Is a pack Like apeddler's sack Does the baby understand?
Then the fly shall kiss her hand;
Put a crumb
Onher thumb,
Maybe he will come.
Catch him? No,
Lethim go,
Never hurt an insect so;
But no doubt
He flies out
Just to gad about.
Nowyou see his wings of silk Drabbled in the baby's milk;
Fie, Ofie,
Foolish fly!
How will he get dry?.
All wet flies
Twist their thighs ;
Thus they wipe their heads and eyes;

: Cats you know,
Wash just so,
Then their whiskers grow.
Flies have hairs too short to comb,
So they fly bareheaded home;
But the gnat Wears a hat
Do you believe that?
Flies can see
More than we,
So how bright their eyes must be!
Little fly,
Ope your eye;
Spiders are near by.
For a secret I can tell,
Spiders never use flies well.
Then away
Do not stay,
Little fly, good day.

UPP the airy mountain,
Down the rushy glen,
We daren't go a-hunting,
For fear of little men;
Wee folk, good folk,
Trooping all together ;
Green jacket, red cap,
Andwhite owl's feather.
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home,
They live on crispy pancakes
Of yellow tide-foam;
Some in the reeds
Of the black mountain-lake,
With frogs for their watch-dogs,
All night awake.
High on the hill-top The old King sits ;
He is now so old and gray He's nigh lost his wits.

Onhis stately journeys From Slieveleague to Rosses

On cold starry nights

Of the gay Northern Lights
.
They stole little Bridget For seven years long;
When she came down again
Her friends were all gone.
They took her lightly back Between the night and morrow
;
They thought that she was fast asleep
,
But she was dead with sorrow
.
They have kept her ever since
Deep within the lakes
,
On
abed of flag leaves
,
Watching till she wakes.
By the craggy hill-side,
Through the mosses bare
,
They have planted thorn trees
For pleasure here and there
.

Inhis bed at night.

THE CHILDREN'


S Hour
By Henry W. Longfellow

ETWEEN the dark and the daylight,
When night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
That is known as the children's hour.
I hear in the chamber above me
The patter of little feet,
The sound of a door that is opened,
And voices soft and sweet.
79
THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
From my study I see in the lamplight,
Descending the broad hall stair,
Grave Alice and laughing Allegra,
And Edith with golden hair.
Awhisper and then a silence,
Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
To take me by surprise.
Asudden rush from the stairway,
Asudden raid from the hall,
By three doors left unguarded,
They enter my castle wall.
They climb up into my turret,
O'er the arms and back of my chair;
If I try to escape, they surround me:
They seem to be everywhere.
They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me intwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
In his Mouse- Tower on the Rhine.
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old mustache as I am
Is not a match for you all?
I have you fast in my fortress,
Andwill not let you depart,
But put you into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart.

Small And Early
By Tudor Jenks

!
HEN Dorothy and I took tea, we sat upon
the floor;
No matter how much tea I drank, she always gave
me more;
Our table was the scarlet box in which her teaset came;
Our guests, an armless one-eyed doll, a wooden
horse gone lame.
She poured out nothing, very fast-the tea pot tipped on high- And in the bowl found sugar lumps unseen by my
dull eye.
11
She added rich ( pretended) cream-it seemed a
wilful waste,
For though she overflowed the cup, it did not change the taste.
She asked, " Take milk?" or "Sugar?" and though I answered "No, "
She put them in, and told me that I "must take it so!"
She'd say "Another cup, Papa?" and I, "No, thank you, Ma'am, "
But then I had to take it-her courtesy was sham.
81
ADVICE
Still, being neither green, nor black, nor English breakfast tea,
It did not give her guests the "nerves"-whatever those may be.
Though often I upset my cup, she only minded when
I would mistake the empty cups for those she'd filled again.
She tasted my cup gingerly, for fear I'd burn my
tongue;
Indeed, she really hurt my pride-she made me feel so young.
I must have drunk some two-score cups, and Dorothy sixteen,
Allowing only needful time to pour them in between.
Westirred with massive pewter spoons, and sipped
in courtly ease,
With all the ceremony of the stately Japanese.
At length she put the cups away, "Good-night,
Papa," she said;
And I went to a real tea, and Dorothy to bed.

And send them home with ho, ho, ho!

Your doll should break her head;
Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose were red?
And wouldn't it be pleasanter
To treat it as a joke,
And say you're glad 'twas dolly's
And not your own that broke?
Suppose you're dressed for walking,
Andthe rain comes pouring down;
Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown?
And wouldn't it be nicer
For you to smile than pout,
And so make sunshine in the house
When there is none without?
Suppose your task, my little man,
Is very hard to get ;
Will it make it any easier
For you to sit and fret?

TO-DAY
And wouldn't it be wiser,
Than waiting like a dunce,
To go to work in earnest
And learn the thing at once?
Suppose that some boys have a horse,
And some a coach and pair ;
Will it tire you less while walking To say, " It isn't fair" ?
And wouldn't it be nobler
To keep your temper sweet,
And in your heart be thankful
You can walk upon your feet?
Suppose the world don't please you.
Nor the way some people do ;
Do you think the whole creation
Willbe altered just for you?
And isn't it, my boy or girl,
The wisest, bravest plan,
Whatever comes, or doesn't come,
To do the best you can?

My Shadow
By Robert Louis Stevenson

HAVE a little shadow that goes in and out with
me,
And what can be the use of him is more than I
can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
The funniest thing about him is the way he likes togrow- Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
88
THE LOST DOLL
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an indiarubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
Andcanonlymake afool of me in everysort ofway.
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you
can see ;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow
sticks to me!
One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepyhead,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep
inbed.

LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,
O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night !
:
O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
!
By Phillips Brooks
LITTLE town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
:
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And, gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of wondering love.
Omorning stars together Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
: And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
:
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Books In Winter
By Robert Louis Stevenson

UMMER fading, winter comesWindow robins, winter rooks,
Andthe picture story-books.
Water now is turned to stone
Nurse and I can walk upon;
Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by Wait upon the children's eye,
Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
In the picture story-books.
Wemay see how all things are,
Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies' looks,
In the picture story-books.

THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
How am I to sing your praise,
Happy chimney-corner days,
Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
Reading picture story-books ?
THE LAND OF STORY-


Books
By Robert Louis Stevenson

T evening when the lamp is lit, AAround the fire my parents sit;
They sit at home and talk and sing,
Anddo not play at anything.
Now, with mylittle gun, Icrawl All in the dark along the wall,
And follow round the forest track
Away behind the sofa back.
There, in the night,where none canspy,
All in myhunter's camp I lie,
Andplay at books that I have read Till it is time to go to bed.
These are the hills, these are the woods,
These are my starry solitudes ;
And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink.
I see the others far away,
As if in firelit camp they lay,
And I, like to an Indian scout,
Around their party prowled about.
94
CHRISTMAS
So, when my nurse comes in for me,
Home I return across the sea,
And go to bed with backward looks At mydear land of Story-books.

Christmas
By Alfred Tennyson

ING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light :
The year is dying in the night- Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new- Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
The year is going, let him go ;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress for all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife;
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
The faithless coldness of the times:
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
95
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
Ring out false pride in place andblood,
The civic slander and the spite:
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love ofgood.....
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land- Ring in the Christ that is to be.
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
W
By Robert Louis Stevenson :
HEN I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
Andall my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills ;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up anddown among the sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
96
BLOCK CITY
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
Andsees before him, dale andplain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.


Block City
By Robert Louis Stevenson

:
WHATHATare you able to build with your blocks?
Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
Rain maykeep raining, and others go roam,
But I can be happy and building at home.
Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,
There I'll establish a city for me:
Akirk and a mill and apalace beside,
And aharbor as well where my vessels may ride.
Great is the palace with pillar andwall,
Asort of a tower on the top of it all,
And steps coming down in an orderly way !
To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.
This one is sailing and that one is moored:
Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings
Coming and going with presents and things !
Now I have done with it, down let it go!
All in amoment the town is laid low.
Block upon block lying scattered and free,
What is there left of my town by the sea?
97
MARCHING SONG
Yet as I saw it, I see it again,
The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men,
Andas long as I live, and where'er Imay be,
I'll always remember my town by the sea.

The Dancers
By Michael Field

DANCE and dance! Another faun,
Ablackone, dances onthe lawn.
He moves with me, and when I lift
My heels his feet directly shift :
Ican't outdance him though I try;
He dances nimbler than I.
I toss myhead and so does he;
What tricks he dares to play onme!
I touch the ivy in my hair ;
Ivy he has and finger there.
The spiteful thing to mock meso!
Iwill outdance him! Ho, ho, ho!

WINTER- TIME

Mary Jane commands the party,
Peter leads the rear ;
Feet in time, alert and hearty,
Each a Grenadier !
All in the most martial manner
Marching double-quick ;
While the napkin like abanner
Waves upon the stick!
Here's enough of fame and pillage,
Great commander Jane!
Nowthat we've been round the village,
Let's go home again.

WINTER-


Time
By Robert Louis Stevenson

ATE lies the wintry sun a-bed,
Afrosty, fiery sleepy-head;
Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
Ablood-red orange, sets again.
Before the stars have left the skies,
Atmorning in the dark I rise;
And, shivering in my nakedness,
Bythe cold candle, bathe anddress.
Closeby the jolly fire Isit To warm my frozen bones a bit ;
Or, with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door.
99
FOREIGN LANDS
When, to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap,
The cold wind burns my face, and blows
Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod;
Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
And tree and house, and hill and lake,
Are frosted like a wedding-cake.

Foreign Lands
By Robert Louis Stevenson

Pinto the cherry tree,
Who should climb but little me?
Iheld the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad onforeign lands.
I saw the next-door garden lie,
Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before.
I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky's blue looking-glass ;
The dusty roads go up and down
With people tramping in to town.
If I could find ahigher tree,
Further and further I should see,
To where the grown-up river slips Into the sea among the ships ;

THE OWL AND THE PUSSY- CAT
To where the roads on either hand
Lead onward into fairy land,
Where all the children dine at five,
Andall the playthings come alive.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT


T
By Edward Lear

HE Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat ;
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the moonabove,
Andsang to a small guitar :
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are !"
Pussy said to the Owl: "You elegant fowl,
How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh, let us be married-too long wehave
tarriedBut what shall we do for a ring?"
They sailed away for ayear and aday
To the land where the bong tree grows ;
And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose.
With a ring at the end of his nose.
101
FOREIGN CHILDREN
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one
shilling
Your ring?" Said the piggy, " I will."
So they took it away, and were married next
day
By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined upon mince and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon,
Andhand in hand on the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon.
They danced by the light of the moon.


Foreign Children
By Robert Louis Stevenson

LITTLE Indian Sioux or Crow,
☑ Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
Oh! don't you wish that you were me?
You have seen the scarlet trees
And the lions over seas ;
Youhave eaten ostrich eggs,
Andturned the turtles off their legs.
Such a life is very fine,
But it's not so nice as mine:
You must often, as you trod,
Have wearied not to be abroad.
102
VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS
You have curious things to eat,
Iam fed on proper meat;
You must dwell beyond the foam,
But I am safe and live at home.
Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
Oh! don't you wish that you were me!
A VISIT FROM ST.


Nicholas
By Clement C. Moore

Twas throughthe night before Christmas, when all
Not a creature was stirring, not even amouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
Whilevisions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
Andmamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's
nap- When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
Isprang from mybed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave a luster of midday to objects below;
When what to my wondering eyes should appear But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.
With alittle old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
103
VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by
name:
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Donder and BlitzenTo the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With a sleigh full of toys-and St. Nicholas, too.
Andthen, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in myhead, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and
soot;
Abundle of toys he had flung on his back,
Andhe looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry ;
His droll little mouthwas drawnup like abow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump-a right jolly old elf- And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
104
THREE KINGS OF ORIENT
Awink of his eye, and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a
jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Andgiving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
Andawaythey all flew like the down of a thistle ;
But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all agood-night !"
THREE KINGS OF ORIENT


W
By J. H. Hopkins

E three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder Star.
Born a babe on Bethlehem plain,
Gold we bring to crown him again;
King for ever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.
105
MY BED IS A BOAT
Oh, star of wonder, star of might,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to the perfect light.


Bed In Summer
By Robert Louis Stevenson

INwinter get up at night Anddress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
Ihave to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people's feet
Still going past me in the street.
Anddoes it not seem hard to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed byday?
MY BED IS A BOAT


M
By Robert Louis Stevenson

Ybed is like a little boat;
Nurse helps me in when I embark;
She girds me in my sailor's coat And starts me in the dark.
106
THE WALRUS
At night, I go onboard and say
Good-night to all my friends on shore;
I shut my eyes and sail away,
And see and hear no more.
And sometimes things to bed I take,
As prudent sailors have to do;
Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
Perhaps a toy or two.
All night across the dark we steer ;
But when the day returns at last,
Safe in my room, beside the pier,
I find my vessel fast.
THE WALRUS AND THE


Carpenter
By Lewis Carroll

THE sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all its might :
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright- Andthis was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Hadgot no business to be there After the day was done-
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"
107
THE WALRUS
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overheadThere were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"
"If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"Idoubt it," said the Carpenter,
Andshed abitter tear.
"Ο Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"Apleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy headMeaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed.
108
THE WALRUS
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat :
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat
Andthis was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four ;
Andthick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more- Allhopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so,
Andthen they rested on a rock Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood Andwaited in a row.
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things :
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax- Of cabbages and kings- Andwhy the sea is boiling hot- And whether pigs have wings. "
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat ;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat ! "
"No hurry! " said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
109
THE WALRUS
1
"Aloaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need :
Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeedNow, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
Adismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine, " the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view ?
"It was so kind of you to come!
And you were very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice.
Iwish you were not quite so deafI've had to ask you twice!"
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick! "
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick! "
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes.
110
THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR
९९"Ο Oysters," said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run !
Shall we be trotting home again ?"
But answer came there noneAnd this was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one.
THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR
SAIY th
By Edward Lear
AID the Table to the Chair,
can hardly be aware ९९
How I suffer from the heat,
And from chilblains on my feet.
If we took a little walk,
We might have a little talk ;
Pray let us take the air, "
Said the Table to the Chair.
Said the Chair unto the Table,
"Now, you know we are not able :
How foolishly you talk,
When you know we cannot walk! "
Said the Table with a sigh,
"It can do no harm to try.
I've as many legs as you :
Why can't we walk on two?"
So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
As they toddled round and round ;
111
A GOOD PLAY
Andeverybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
"See! the Table and the Chair !
Have come out to take the air !"
But in going down an alley,
To a castle in a valley,
They completely lost their way,
Andwandered all the day;
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.
Then they whispered to each other,
"O delightful little brother,
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon."
So the Ducky and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds.

And filled it full of sofa pillows
To go a-sailing on the billows.

GOD REST YE
We took a saw and several nails,
Andwater in the nursery pails ;
And Tom said, "Let us also take
An apple and a slice of cake;"_
Which was enough for Tom and me
To go a-sailing on, till tea.
We sailed along for days and days,
Andhad the very best of plays ;
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
So there was no one left but me.
GOD REST YE,


Merry Gentlemen
By Dinah Maria Mulock

OD rest ye, merry gentlemen; let nothing you ☑ dismay,
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
The dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone
through the gray,
When Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on
Christmas-day.
God rest ye, little children; let nothing you
affright,
For Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;
Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping
lay,
When Christ, the child of Nazareth, was born on
Christmas-day.
113
A LOBSTER QUADRILLE
God rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed
morn
The Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:
Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.


A Lobster Quadrille
By Lewis Carroll

"WILLyouwalkalittle faster?" said awhit-
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's tread- ing on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won'tyou, won't you join the dance?
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
Whenthey take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askanceSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

The further off from England the nearer is to FranceThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and jointhe dance.
