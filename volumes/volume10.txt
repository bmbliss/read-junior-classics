LITTLE PIG

Anonymous
Nold womanwas sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked sixpence. "What," said
she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go
to market, and buy a little pig."
As she was coming home, she came to a stile ;
but the pig would not go over the stile.
She went a little further, and she met adog. So she said to the dog-
"Dog, dog, bite pig!
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the dog would not.

THE OLD WOMAN
She went a little further, and she met a stick. So
she said-
"Stick, stick, beat dog!
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night. "
But the stick would not.
She went a little further, and she met a fire. So
she said-
"Fire, fire, burn stick!
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig ;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the fire would not.
She went a little further, and she met some
water. So she said-
"Water, water, quench fire !
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dogwon't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the water would not.
So she went a little further, and she met an ox.
So she said

THE OLD WOMAN
"Ox, ox, drink water!
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick ;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig ;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the ox would not.
She went a little further, and she met a butcher.
So she said-
"Butcher, butcher, kill ox!
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the butcher would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rope.
So she saidJun. Cl-10
"Rope, rope, hang butcher!
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick ;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig ;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night. "

THE OLD WOMAN
But the rope would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rat. So
she said-
"Rat, rat, gnaw rope !
Rope won't hang butcher;
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water ;
Water won't quench fire ;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog ;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the rat would not.
She went a little further, and she met a cat. So
she said-
"Cat, cat, kill rat!
Rat won't gnaw rope;
Rope won't hang butcher;
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water ;
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
The cat said, "If you will give me a saucer of milk, I will kill the rat. "

THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS
So the old woman gave the cat the milk, and
when she had lapped up the milkThe cat began to kill the rat ;
The rat began to gnaw the rope;
The rope began to hang the butcher ;
The butcher began to kill the ox;
The ox began to drink the water ;
The water began to quench the fire ;
The fire began to burn the stick ;
The stick began to beat the dog;
The dog began to bite the pig ;
The pig jumped over the stile,
And so the old woman got home that night.

PUSSY
By Jane Taylor
LIKE little Pussy, her coat is so warm,
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm;
So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
ButPussy and I very gently will play;
She shall sit by my side, and I'll give her some
food;
And she'll love me, because I am gentle and good.
I'll pat little Pussy, and then she will purr,
Andthus show her thanks for my kindness to her;
I'll not pinch her ears, nor tread on her paw,
Lest I should provoke her to use her sharp claw;
I never will vex her, nor make her displeased,
For Pussy don't like to be worried or teased.

THE SLEEPY SONG
By Josephine Daskam Bacon
S soon as the fire burns red and low
Andthe house upstairs is still,
She sings me a queer little sleepy song,
Of sheep that go over the hill.
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
Their colors are gray and white;
They follow their leader nose and tail,
For they must be home by night.
Andone slips over, and one comes next,
Andone runs after behind;
The gray one's nose at the white one's tail,
The top of the hill they find.

TWENTY FROGGIES
Andwhen they get to the top of the hill
They quietly slip away,
But one runs over, and one comes next,
Their colors are white and gray.
And over they go, and over they go,
And over the top of the hill
The good little sheep run quick and soft,
And the house upstairs is still.
And one slips over, and one comes next,
The good little, gray little sheep !
Iwatchhow the fire burns red and low,
Andshe says that I fall asleep.

TWENTY FROGGIES
ByGeorge Cooper
WENTY froggies went to school,
Down beside a rushy pool,
Twenty little coats of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
"We must be in time," said they, ...
"First we study, then we play;
That is how we keep the rule,
When we froggies go to school."
Master Bull-frog, brave and stern,
Called his classes in their turn,
Taught them how to nobly strive,
Alsohow to leap and dive;

A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
Taught them how to dodge a blow,
From the sticks that bad boys throw.
Twenty froggies grew up fast,
Bull-frogs they became at last ;
Polished in a high degree,
As each froggie ought to be,
Now they sit on other logs,
Teaching other little frogs.
A CHILD'S EVEN SONG
By Richard Le Gallienne
So far and fast to-day;
ran
The birds are weary, for who sang
So many songs as they?
The bees and butterflies at last
Are tired out, for just think, too,
Howmany gardens through the day Their little wings have fluttered through,
And so, as all tired people do,
They've gone to lay their sleepy heads Deep, deep in warm and happy beds.
The sun has shut his golden eye
And gone to sleep beneath the sky,
The birds and butterflies and bees
Have all crept into flowers and trees,
And all lie quiet, still as mice,
Till morning comes-like father's voice.
So Geoffrey, Owen, Phyllis, you

SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!
Must sleep away till morning, too.
Close little eyes, down little heads,
And sleep-sleep-sleep in happy beds.

USH! the waves are rolling in,
White with foam, white with foam;
Father toils amid the din ;
But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the winds roar hoarse and deepOnthey come, on they come !

But baby sleeps at home.
Hush! the rain sweeps o'er the knowes,
Where they roam, where they roam;

LADY BUTTON-EYES
Sleep, baby, sleep !
The large stars are the sheep ;
The little stars are the lambs, I guess ;
And the gentle moon is the shepherdess.
Sleep, baby, sleep !
Sleep, baby, sleep!
Our Saviour loves His sheep ;
He is the Lamb of God on high,
Who for our sakes came down to die.
Sleep, baby, sleep!
LADY BUTTON-EYES
By Eugene Field
WHENAnd mytheweary busyday littleisone done,
Rocketh gently to and fro ;
When the night winds softly blow,
And the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again;
When upon the haunted green Fairies dance around their queenThen from yonder misty skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
:
Through the murk and mist and gloam
To our quiet, cosy home,
Where to singing, sweet and low,
Rocks a cradle to and fro ;
Where the clock's dull monotone
Telleth of the day that's done;

LADY BUTTON- EYES
Where the moonbeams hover o'er
Playthings sleeping on the floor- Where my weary wee one lies
Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Cometh like a fleeting ghost
From some distant eerie coast;
Never footfall can you hear
As that spirit fareth nearNever whisper, never word From that shadow-queen is heard.
In ethereal raiment dight,
From the realm of fay and sprite
In the depth of yonder skies Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Layeth she her hands upon My dear weary little one,
And those white hands overspread
Like a veil the curly head,
Seem to fondle and caress
Every little silken tress ;
Then she smooths the eyelids down
Over those two eyes of brown- In such soothing, tender wise Cometh Lady Button-Eyes.
Dearest, feel upon your brow That caressing magic now;
For the crickets in the glen Chirp and chirp and chirp again,
While upon the haunted green
Fairies dance around their queen,

THE ROCK-A- BY LADY

THE ROCK-A-BY LADY
By Eugene Field
HE Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street Comes stealing; comes creeping;
The poppies they hang from her head to her
feet,
And each hath a dream that is tiny and fleetShe bringeth her poppies to you, my sweet,
When she findeth you sleeping!
There is one little dream of a beautiful drum-
"Rub-a-dub!" it goeth;
There is one little dream of abig sugar-plum,
And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come
Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum,
And a trumpet that bloweth !
And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing;
Andboats go a-floating on silvery streams,
And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty
gleams,
And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams,
The fairies go winging!

THE NEW MOON
Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny
and fleet?
They'll come to you sleeping;
So shut the two eyes that are weary, my sweet,
For the Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby street,
With poppies that hang from her head to her feet,
Comes stealing; comes creeping.

THE NEW MOON
Anonymous
EAR mother, how pretty The moon looks to-night!
She was never so cunning before;
Her two little horns
Are so sharp and so bright,
Ihope she'll not grow any more.
If I were up there,
With you and my friends,
I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;
I'd sit in the middle
Andhold by both ends ;
Oh, what abright cradle 'twould be!
Iwould call to the stars
To keep out of the way,
Lest we should rock over their toes ;
And then I would rock
Till the dawn of the day,
And see where the pretty moon goes.

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
And there we would stay
In the beautiful skies,
And through the bright clouds we would roam We would see the sun set,
And see the sun rise,
And on the next rainbow come home.
THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
W"
By Mary Howitt
ILL you walk into my parlor?"
aspider to a fly;
" Tis the prettiest little parlor That ever you did spy.
The way into my parlor.
Is up a winding stair,
And I have many pretty things To show when you are there."
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"To ask me is in vain;
For who goes up your winding stair Can ne'er come down again."
"I'm sure you must be weary With soaring up so high;
Will you rest upon mylittle bed?"
Said the spider to the fly.
"There are pretty curtains drawn around,
The sheets are fine and thin;
And if you like to rest awhile,
I'll snugly tuck you in. "

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
"Oh, no, no!" said the little fly,
"For I've often heard it said,
They never, never wake again
Who sleep upon your bed."
Said the cunning spider to the fly,
"Dear friend, what shall I do
To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?
I have within my pantry Good store of all that's nice ;
I'm sure you're very welcome- Willyou please to take a slice?"
"Oh, no, no! " said the little fly,
"Kind sir, that cannot be;
I've heard what's in your pantry,
And I do not wish to see."
"Sweet creature," said the spider,
"You're witty and you're wise ;
How handsome are your gauzy wings,
How brilliant are your eyes.
I have a little looking-glass Upon my parlor shelf ;
If you'll step in one moment, dear,
You shall behold yourself."
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,
"For what you're pleased to say,
And bidding you good-morning, now,
I'll call another day."
The spider turned him round about,
And went into his den,

THE SPIDER AND THE FLY
For well he knew the silly fly
Would soon be back again;
So he wove a subtle thread
In a little corner sly,
And set his table ready
To dine upon the fly.
Hewent out to his door again,
Andmerrily did sing,
"Come hither, hither, pretty fly,
With the pearl and silver wing;
Your robes are green and purple,
There's a crest upon your head;
Your eyes are like the diamond bright,
But mine are dull as lead."
Alas, alas ! how very soon This silly little fly,
Hearing his wily, flattering words,
Came slowly flitting by:
With buzzing wings she hung aloft,
Then near and nearer drewThought only of her brilliant eyes,
Andgreen and purple hue;
Thought only of her crested head- Poor foolish thing ! At last Upjumped the cunning spider,
And fiercely held her fast.
Hedragged her up his winding stair,
Into his dismal den
Within his little parlor-but
She ne'er came out again!

THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE
And now, dear little children
Whomay this story read,
To idle, silly, flattering words,
I pray you, ne'er give heed:

Close heart and ear and eye,

THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE
AVE you
Tree?
By Eugene Field
ever heard of the Sugar-Plum
'Tis a marvel of great renown!
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea,
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet (As those who have tasted it say)
That good little children have only to eat Of that fruit to be happy next day.
When you've got to the tree, you would have a
hard time
To capture the fruit which I sing;
The tree is so tall that no person could climb
To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,
And agingerbread dog prowls below- And this is the way you contrive to get at Those sugar-plums tempting you so:

YOUNG NIGHT- THOUGHT
|
You say but the word to that gingerbread dog And he barks with such terrible zest
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,
As her swelling proportions attest.
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
From this leafy limb unto that,
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground- Hurrah for that chocolate cat !
There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and pepper- mint canes,
With stripings of scarlet or gold,
And you carry away of the treasure that rains As much as your apron can hold !
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me
In your dainty white nightcap and gown,
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.
YOUNG NIGHT- THOUGHT
By Robert Louis Stevenson
LL night long and every night, AWhenmy mamma puts out the light,
Isee the people marching by,
Asplain as day, before my eye.
Armies and emperors and kings,
All carrying different kinds of things,
Andmarching in so grand away,
You never saw the like by day.

LULLABY
So fine a show was never seen
Atthe great circus on the green ;
For every kind of beast and man Is marching in that caravan.
At first they move a little slow,
But still the faster on they go,
And still beside them close I keep
Until we reach the town of Sleep.
LULLABY OF AN INFANT CHIEF
By Sir Walter Scott
HUSH thee, my baby, thy sire was aknight,
a lady both lovely and bright;
The woods and the glens from the tower which we
see,
They all are belonging, dear baby, to thee.
O, fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows,
It calls but the warders that guard thy repose ;
Their bows would be bended, their blades would be
red,
Ere the step of a foeman draws near to thy bed.
O, hush thee, my baby, the time will soon come When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you
may,
For strife comes with manhood, and waking with
day.

SWEET AND LOW
By Alfred Tennyson
WEET and low, sweet and low,
Wind of the western sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow,
Wind of the western sea!
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon and blow,
Blow him again to me;
While my little one, while my pretty one sleeps
Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
Father will come to thee soon;
Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
Father will come to thee soon;
Father will come to his babe in the nest,
Silver sails all out of the west
Under the silver moon:
Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

Into a sea of dew.
"Where are yougoing, and what doyou wish?"

WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD

"Wehave come to fish for the herring fish That live in this beautiful sea ;
Nets of silver and gold have we ! "
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish That lived in that beautiful sea-
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish- Never afeard are we " ;
So cried the stars to the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.
All night long their nets they threw To the stars in the twinkling foamThen down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home ;
'Twas all so pretty a sail it seemed As if it could not be,
And some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd
dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful seaBut I shall name you the fishermen three :
Wynken,
Blynken,
AndNod.

CUDDLE DOWN, DOLLY
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed.
So shut your eyes while mother sings
Ofwonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things As you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three :

AMORTIFYING MISTAKE
By Anna Maria Pratt
STUDIED my tables over and over, and backward and forward too ;
But I couldn't remember six times nine, and I
didn't know what to do,
Till sister told me to play with mydoll, and not to
bother my head.
"If you call her 'Fifty-four' for a while, you'll learn it by heart," she said.
So I took my favorite, Mary Ann (though I
thought ' twas a dreadful shame To give such a perfectly lovely child such a per- fectly horrid name) ,
And I called her my dear little "Fifty-four" a
hundred times, till I knew
The answer of six times nine as well as the answer
of two times two.

MAIDENHOOD
Next day Elizabeth Wigglesworth, who always acts so proud,
Said, " Six times nine is fifty-two," and I nearly laughed aloud!
But I wished I hadn't when teacher said, "Now,
Dorothy, tell if you can."
For I thought of my doll and-sakes alive -I!
answered, "Mary Ann! "

Thou whose locks outshine the sun,
Golden tresses, wreathed in one,
As the braided streamlets run!
Standing, with reluctant feet,
Where the brook and river meet,
Womanhood and childhood fleet !
Gazing, with a timid glance,
Onthe brooklet's swift advance,
On the river's broad expanse!
Deep and still, that gliding stream Beautiful to thee must seem,
As the river of adream.

MAIDENHOOD
Then why pause with indecision,
When bright angels in thy vision
Beckon thee to fields Elysian?
Seest thou shadows sailing by,
As the dove, with startled eye,
Sees the falcon's shadow fly?
Hearest thou voices on the shore,
That our ears perceive no more,
Deafened by the cataract's roar?
O, thou child of many prayers !
Life hath quicksands-Life hath snares!
Care and age come unawares!
Like the swell of some sweet tune,
Morning rises into noon,
Mayglides onward into June.
Childhood is the bough, where slumbered Birds and blossoms many-numbered;-
Age, that bough with snows encumbered.
Gather, then, each flower that grows,
Whenthe young heart overflows,
To embalm that tent of snows.
Bear a lily in thy hand;
Gates of brass cannot withstand
The touch of that magic wand.

WILLIE WINKIE
Bear through sorrow, wrong, and ruth,
In thy heart the dew of youth,
On thy lips the smile of truth.
O, that dew, like balm, shall steal
Into wounds, that cannot heal,
Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;
And that smile, like sunshine, dart
Into many a sunless heart,
For a smile of God thou art. ::

THE GIANT
By Charles Mackay
HERE came a Giant to my door,
AGiant fierce and strong;
His step was heavy on the floor,
His arms were ten yards long.
He scowled and frowned; he shook the
ground;
I trembled through and through;
At length I looked him in the face And cried, "Who cares for you?"

MARJORIE'S ALMANAC
The mighty Giant, as I spoke,
Grewpale and thin and small,
And through his body, as 'twere smoke,
I saw the sunshine fall.
His blood- red eyes turned blue as skies;-
"Is this," I cried, with growing pride,
"Is this the mighty foe?"
:
He sank before my earnest face,
He vanished quite away,
Andleft no shadow inhis place Between me and the day.
Such giants come to strike us dumb,
But, weak in every part,
They melt before the strong man's eyes,
Andfly the true of heart.

"I wonder if he knew

By Susan Coolidge
'LL tell you how the leaves came down,"
The great Tree to his children said:
"You're getting sleepy, Yellow and Brown,
Yes, very sleepy, little Red.
It is quite time to go to bed."
"Ah!" begged each silly, pouting leaf,
"Let us a little longer stay ;
Dear Father Tree, behold our grief!
'Tis such avery pleasant day,
Wedo not want to go away."
So, for just one more merry day To the great Tree the leaflets clung,
Frolicked and danced, and had their way,
Upon the autumn breezes swung,
Whispering all their sports among70

"Perhaps the great Tree will forget,
And let us stay until the spring,
If we all beg, andcoax, and fret."
But the great Tree did no such thing;
He smiled to hear their whispering.
"Come, children, all to bed," he cried;
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer,
He shook his head, and far and wide,
Fluttering and rustling everywhere,
Down sped the leaflets through the air.
I saw them; on the ground they lay,
Golden and red, ahuddled swarm,
Waiting till one from far away,
White bedclothes heaped uponher arm,
Should come to wrap them safe and warm.
The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.
"Good-night, dear little leaves," he said.
And from below each sleepy child Replied, "Good-night," and murmured,
"It is so nice to go to bed!"

Mounting, whirling, sailing,
Full of mirth ;

Waving round ;

Let us watch him, you and I.. How he crawls
Up the walls,
Yet he never falls !
I believe with six such legs
You and I could walk on eggs.

BABY BYE
There he goes
On his toes,
Tickling Baby's nose.
Spots of red
Dot his head;
Rainbows on his back are spread;
That small speck Is his neck;
See him nod and beck.
I can show you, if you choose,
Where to look to find his shoesThree small pairs,
Made of hairs ;
These he always wears.
Black and brown
Is his gown;
He can wear it upside down;
Itis laced
Round his waist;
I admire his taste.
Yet though tight his clothes are made,
He will lose them, I'm afraid,
If to-night
He gets sight
Of the candle-light.
Inthe sun
Webs are spun;
What if he gets into one?
When it rains
Hecomplains
Onthe window-panes.

Sohe sings
Withhis buzzingwings.

Bread and meat;
There's his mouth between his feet.
Onhis back

Then the fly shall kiss her hand;
Put a crumb
Onher thumb,
Maybe he will come.
Catch him? No,
Lethim go,
Never hurt an insect so;
But no doubt
He flies out
Just to gad about.
Nowyou see his wings of silk Drabbled in the baby's milk;
Fie, Ofie,
Foolish fly!
How will he get dry?.
All wet flies
Twist their thighs ;
Thus they wipe their heads and eyes;

So how bright their eyes must be!

Spiders are near by.
For a secret I can tell,
Spiders never use flies well.
Then away
Do not stay,
Little fly, good day.

Andwhite owl's feather.
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home,
They live on crispy pancakes
Of yellow tide-foam;
Some in the reeds
Of the black mountain-lake,
With frogs for their watch-dogs,
All night awake.

He is now so old and gray He's nigh lost his wits.

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
By Henry W. Longfellow
ETWEEN the dark and the daylight,
When night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
That is known as the children's hour.
I hear in the chamber above me
The patter of little feet,
The sound of a door that is opened,
And voices soft and sweet.

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
From my study I see in the lamplight,
Descending the broad hall stair,
Grave Alice and laughing Allegra,
And Edith with golden hair.
Awhisper and then a silence,
Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
To take me by surprise.
Asudden rush from the stairway,
Asudden raid from the hall,
By three doors left unguarded,
They enter my castle wall.
They climb up into my turret,
O'er the arms and back of my chair;
If I try to escape, they surround me:
They seem to be everywhere.
They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me intwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
In his Mouse- Tower on the Rhine.
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old mustache as I am
Is not a match for you all?
I have you fast in my fortress,
Andwill not let you depart,
But put you into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart.

And there will I keep you forever,
Yes, forever and aday,
Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
Andmoulder in dust away.

SMALL AND EARLY
By Tudor Jenks
!
HEN Dorothy and I took tea, we sat upon
the floor;
No matter how much tea I drank, she always gave
me more;
Our table was the scarlet box in which her teaset came;
Our guests, an armless one-eyed doll, a wooden
horse gone lame.
She poured out nothing, very fast-the tea pot tipped on high- And in the bowl found sugar lumps unseen by my
dull eye.

She added rich ( pretended) cream-it seemed a
wilful waste,
For though she overflowed the cup, it did not change the taste.
She asked, " Take milk?" or "Sugar?" and though I answered "No, "
She put them in, and told me that I "must take it so!"
She'd say "Another cup, Papa?" and I, "No, thank you, Ma'am, "
But then I had to take it-her courtesy was sham.

ADVICE
Still, being neither green, nor black, nor English breakfast tea,
It did not give her guests the "nerves"-whatever those may be.
Though often I upset my cup, she only minded when
I would mistake the empty cups for those she'd filled again.
She tasted my cup gingerly, for fear I'd burn my
tongue;
Indeed, she really hurt my pride-she made me feel so young.
I must have drunk some two-score cups, and Dorothy sixteen,
Allowing only needful time to pour them in between.
Westirred with massive pewter spoons, and sipped
in courtly ease,
With all the ceremony of the stately Japanese.
At length she put the cups away, "Good-night,
Papa," she said;
And I went to a real tea, and Dorothy to bed.

SUPPOSE
By Phœbe Cary
UPPOSE, my little lady,
Your doll should break her head;
Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose were red?
And wouldn't it be pleasanter
To treat it as a joke,
And say you're glad 'twas dolly's
And not your own that broke?
Suppose you're dressed for walking,
Andthe rain comes pouring down;
Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown?
And wouldn't it be nicer
For you to smile than pout,
And so make sunshine in the house
When there is none without?
Suppose your task, my little man,
Is very hard to get ;
Will it make it any easier
For you to sit and fret?

TO-DAY
And wouldn't it be wiser,
Than waiting like a dunce,
To go to work in earnest
And learn the thing at once?
Suppose that some boys have a horse,
And some a coach and pair ;
Will it tire you less while walking To say, " It isn't fair" ?
And wouldn't it be nobler
To keep your temper sweet,
And in your heart be thankful
You can walk upon your feet?
Suppose the world don't please you.
Nor the way some people do ;
Do you think the whole creation
Willbe altered just for you?
And isn't it, my boy or girl,
The wisest, bravest plan,
Whatever comes, or doesn't come,
To do the best you can?

me,
And what can be the use of him is more than I
can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
The funniest thing about him is the way he likes togrow- Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;

THE LOST DOLL
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an indiarubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
Andcanonlymake afool of me in everysort ofway.
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you
can see ;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow
sticks to me!
One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepyhead,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep
inbed.

UMMER fading, winter comesWindow robins, winter rooks,
Andthe picture story-books.
Water now is turned to stone
Nurse and I can walk upon;
Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by Wait upon the children's eye,
Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
In the picture story-books.
Wemay see how all things are,
Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies' looks,
In the picture story-books.

THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
How am I to sing your praise,
Happy chimney-corner days,
Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
Reading picture story-books ?
THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
T evening when the lamp is lit, AAround the fire my parents sit;
They sit at home and talk and sing,
Anddo not play at anything.
Now, with mylittle gun, Icrawl All in the dark along the wall,
And follow round the forest track
Away behind the sofa back.
There, in the night,where none canspy,
All in myhunter's camp I lie,
Andplay at books that I have read Till it is time to go to bed.
These are the hills, these are the woods,
These are my starry solitudes ;
And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink.
I see the others far away,
As if in firelit camp they lay,
And I, like to an Indian scout,
Around their party prowled about.

CHRISTMAS
So, when my nurse comes in for me,
Home I return across the sea,
And go to bed with backward looks At mydear land of Story-books.

CHRISTMAS
By Alfred Tennyson
ING out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light :
The year is dying in the night- Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new- Ring, happy bells, across the snow;
The year is going, let him go ;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress for all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife;
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
The faithless coldness of the times:
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.

THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
Ring out false pride in place andblood,
The civic slander and the spite:
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love ofgood.....
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land- Ring in the Christ that is to be.
THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE
W
By Robert Louis Stevenson :
HEN I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
Andall my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills ;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up anddown among the sheets ;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.

BLOCK CITY
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
Andsees before him, dale andplain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.
BLOCK CITY
By Robert Louis Stevenson
:
WHATHATare you able to build with your blocks?
Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
Rain maykeep raining, and others go roam,
But I can be happy and building at home.
Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,
There I'll establish a city for me:
Akirk and a mill and apalace beside,
And aharbor as well where my vessels may ride.
Great is the palace with pillar andwall,
Asort of a tower on the top of it all,
And steps coming down in an orderly way !
To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.
This one is sailing and that one is moored:
Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings
Coming and going with presents and things !
Now I have done with it, down let it go!
All in amoment the town is laid low.
Block upon block lying scattered and free,
What is there left of my town by the sea?

MARCHING SONG
Yet as I saw it, I see it again,
The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men,
Andas long as I live, and where'er Imay be,
I'll always remember my town by the sea.

THE DANCERS
By Michael Field
DANCE and dance! Another faun,
Ablackone, dances onthe lawn.
He moves with me, and when I lift
My heels his feet directly shift :
Ican't outdance him though I try;
He dances nimbler than I.
I toss myhead and so does he;
What tricks he dares to play onme!
I touch the ivy in my hair ;
Ivy he has and finger there.
The spiteful thing to mock meso!
Iwill outdance him! Ho, ho, ho!
MARCHING SONG
By Robert Louis Stevenson
Burching, here wecome!
RING the comb andplayuponit!
Willie cocks his Highland bonnet,
Johnnie beats the drum.

WINTER- TIME
Jun. Cl-10
Mary Jane commands the party,
Peter leads the rear ;
Feet in time, alert and hearty,
Each a Grenadier !
All in the most martial manner
Marching double-quick ;
While the napkin like abanner
Waves upon the stick!
Here's enough of fame and pillage,
Great commander Jane!
Nowthat we've been round the village,
Let's go home again.

WINTER- TIME
By Robert Louis Stevenson
ATE lies the wintry sun a-bed,
Afrosty, fiery sleepy-head;
Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
Ablood-red orange, sets again.
Before the stars have left the skies,
Atmorning in the dark I rise;
And, shivering in my nakedness,
Bythe cold candle, bathe anddress.
Closeby the jolly fire Isit To warm my frozen bones a bit ;
Or, with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door.

FOREIGN LANDS
When, to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap,
The cold wind burns my face, and blows
Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod;
Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
And tree and house, and hill and lake,
Are frosted like a wedding-cake.
UP
FOREIGN LANDS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
Pinto the cherry tree,
Who should climb but little me?
Iheld the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad onforeign lands.
I saw the next-door garden lie,
Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before.
I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky's blue looking-glass ;
The dusty roads go up and down
With people tramping in to town.
If I could find ahigher tree,
Further and further I should see,
To where the grown-up river slips Into the sea among the ships ;

THE OWL AND THE PUSSY- CAT
To where the roads on either hand
Lead onward into fairy land,
Where all the children dine at five,
Andall the playthings come alive.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT
T
By Edward Lear
HE Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat ;
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the moonabove,
Andsang to a small guitar :
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are !"
Pussy said to the Owl: "You elegant fowl,
How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh, let us be married-too long wehave
tarriedBut what shall we do for a ring?"
They sailed away for ayear and aday
To the land where the bong tree grows ;
And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose.
With a ring at the end of his nose.

FOREIGN CHILDREN
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one
shilling
Your ring?" Said the piggy, " I will."
So they took it away, and were married next
day
By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined upon mince and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon,
Andhand in hand on the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon.
They danced by the light of the moon.
FOREIGN CHILDREN
By Robert Louis Stevenson
LITTLE Indian Sioux or Crow,
☑ Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
Oh! don't you wish that you were me?
You have seen the scarlet trees
And the lions over seas ;
Youhave eaten ostrich eggs,
Andturned the turtles off their legs.
Such a life is very fine,
But it's not so nice as mine:
You must often, as you trod,
Have wearied not to be abroad.

VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS
You have curious things to eat,
Iam fed on proper meat;
You must dwell beyond the foam,
But I am safe and live at home.
Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
Oh! don't you wish that you were me!
A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS
By Clement C. Moore
Twas throughthe night before Christmas, when all
Not a creature was stirring, not even amouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
Whilevisions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
Andmamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's
nap- When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
Isprang from mybed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave a luster of midday to objects below;
When what to my wondering eyes should appear But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.
With alittle old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by
name:
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Donder and BlitzenTo the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With a sleigh full of toys-and St. Nicholas, too.
Andthen, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in myhead, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and
soot;
Abundle of toys he had flung on his back,
Andhe looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry ;
His droll little mouthwas drawnup like abow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump-a right jolly old elf- And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;

THREE KINGS OF ORIENT
Awink of his eye, and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his
work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a
jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Andgiving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
Andawaythey all flew like the down of a thistle ;
But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all agood-night !"
THREE KINGS OF ORIENT
W
By J. H. Hopkins
E three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder Star.
Born a babe on Bethlehem plain,
Gold we bring to crown him again;
King for ever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Prayer and praising all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.

MY BED IS A BOAT
Oh, star of wonder, star of might,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to the perfect light.
BED IN SUMMER
By Robert Louis Stevenson
INwinter get up at night Anddress by yellow candle-light.
In summer, quite the other way,
I have to go to bed by day.
Ihave to go to bed and see
The birds still hopping on the tree,
Or hear the grown-up people's feet
Still going past me in the street.
Anddoes it not seem hard to you,
When all the sky is clear and blue,
And I should like so much to play,
To have to go to bed byday?
MY BED IS A BOAT
M
By Robert Louis Stevenson
Ybed is like a little boat;
Nurse helps me in when I embark;
She girds me in my sailor's coat And starts me in the dark.

THE WALRUS
At night, I go onboard and say
Good-night to all my friends on shore;
I shut my eyes and sail away,
And see and hear no more.
And sometimes things to bed I take,
As prudent sailors have to do;
Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
Perhaps a toy or two.
All night across the dark we steer ;
But when the day returns at last,
Safe in my room, beside the pier,
I find my vessel fast.
THE WALRUS AND THE
CARPENTER
By Lewis Carroll
THE sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all its might :
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright- Andthis was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Hadgot no business to be there After the day was done-
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

THE WALRUS
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overheadThere were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"
"If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"Idoubt it," said the Carpenter,
Andshed abitter tear.
"Ο Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"Apleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy headMeaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster-bed.

THE WALRUS
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat :
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat
Andthis was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four ;
Andthick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more- Allhopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so,
Andthen they rested on a rock Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood Andwaited in a row.
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things :
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax- Of cabbages and kings- Andwhy the sea is boiling hot- And whether pigs have wings. "
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat ;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat ! "
"No hurry! " said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.

THE WALRUS

"Aloaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need :
Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeedNow, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
Adismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine, " the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view ?
"It was so kind of you to come!
And you were very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice.
Iwish you were not quite so deafI've had to ask you twice!"
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick! "
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick! "
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes.

THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR
९९"Ο Oysters," said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run !
Shall we be trotting home again ?"
But answer came there noneAnd this was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one.
THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR
SAIY th
By Edward Lear
AID the Table to the Chair,
can hardly be aware ९९
How I suffer from the heat,
And from chilblains on my feet.
If we took a little walk,
We might have a little talk ;
Pray let us take the air, "
Said the Table to the Chair.
Said the Chair unto the Table,
"Now, you know we are not able :
How foolishly you talk,
When you know we cannot walk! "
Said the Table with a sigh,
"It can do no harm to try.
I've as many legs as you :
Why can't we walk on two?"
So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
As they toddled round and round ;

A GOOD PLAY
Andeverybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
"See! the Table and the Chair !
Have come out to take the air !"
But in going down an alley,
To a castle in a valley,
They completely lost their way,
Andwandered all the day;
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.
Then they whispered to each other,
"O delightful little brother,
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon."
So the Ducky and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds.
A GOOD PLAY
By Robert Louis Stevenson
TEbuilt W
a ship upon the stairs All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
And filled it full of sofa pillows
To go a-sailing on the billows.

GOD REST YE
We took a saw and several nails,
Andwater in the nursery pails ;
And Tom said, "Let us also take
An apple and a slice of cake;"_
Which was enough for Tom and me
To go a-sailing on, till tea.
We sailed along for days and days,
Andhad the very best of plays ;
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
So there was no one left but me.
GOD REST YE, MERRY GENTLEMEN
By Dinah Maria Mulock
OD rest ye, merry gentlemen; let nothing you ☑ dismay,
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
The dawn rose red o'er Bethlehem, the stars shone
through the gray,
When Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on
Christmas-day.
God rest ye, little children; let nothing you
affright,
For Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;
Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping
lay,
When Christ, the child of Nazareth, was born on
Christmas-day.

A LOBSTER QUADRILLE
God rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed
morn
The Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:
Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.
A LOBSTER QUADRILLE
By Lewis Carroll
"WILLyouwalkalittle faster?" said awhit-
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's tread- ing on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won'tyou, won't you join the dance?
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
Whenthey take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askanceSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

YOUNG DANDELION
Would not, could not, would not, could not,
would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not,
could not join the dance.
"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied,
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to FranceThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and jointhe dance.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?" ..

JOHN GILPIN
By William Cowper
OHN GILPIN was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
Atrain-band captain eke was he
Of famous London Town.
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
"Though wedded we have been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we No holiday have seen.
"To-morrow is our wedding-day,
Andwe will then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton,
All in achaise and pair.

JOHN GILPIN
"My sister and my sister's child,
Myself, and children three,
Will fill the chaise ; so you must ride On horseback after we."
He soon replied, "I do admire Of womankind but one,
And you are she, my dearest dear,
Therefore it shall be done.
"I am a linendraper bold,
As all the world doth know,
Andmy good friend, the Calender,
Will lend his horse to go."
Quoth Mistress Gilpin, "That's well said;
And, for that wine is dear,
Wewill be furnish'd with our own,
Which is both bright and clear."
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;
O'erjoy'd was he to find
That, though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.
The morning came, the chaise was brought,
But yet was not allow'd To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog To dash through thick and thin.

JOHN GILPIN
Smackwent the whip, round went the wheels ;
Were never folks so glad:
The stones did rattle underneath,
As if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin, at his horse's side,
Seized fast the flowing mane,
Andup he got, in haste to ride,
But soon came down again;
For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,
His journey to begin,
When, turning round his head, he saw
Three customers come in.
So down he came; for loss of time Although it grieved him sore,
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
Would trouble him much more.
'Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind,
When Betty, screaming, came downstairs,
"The wine is left behind!"
"Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
My leathern belt likewise,
In which I bear my trusty sword
When I do exercise."
Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
Had two stone-bottles found,
To hold the liquor that she loved,
Andkeep it safe and sound.

JOHN GILPIN
Each bottle had a curling ear,
Through which the belt he drew,
And hung a bottle on each side,
To make his balance true.
Then over all, that he might be
Equipp'd from top to toe,
His long red cloak, well-brush'd and neat,
He manfully did throw.
Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed,
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
With caution and good heed.
But finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot,
Which gall'd him in his seat.
So, "Fair and softly!" John he cried,
But John he cried in vain ;
That trot became agallop soon,
In spite of curb and rein.
So stooping down, as needs he must Who cannot sit upright,
He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,
And eke with all his might.
His horse, who never in that sort
Had handled been before,
What thing uponhis back had got Did wonder more and more.

JOHN GILPIN
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
Away went hat and wig;
He little dreamt, when he set out,
Of running such a rig.
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
Like streamer long and gay,
Till loop and button failing both,
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern The bottles he had slung;
Abottle swinging at each side,
Ashath been said or sung.
The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,
Up flew the windows all ;
Andevery soul cried out: "Well done!"
As loud as he could bawl.
Awaywent Gilpin-who but he?
His fame soon spread around,
"He carries weight; he rides a race!
'Tis for a thousand pound! "
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view
How in a trice the turnpike men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now, as he went bowing down His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shatter'd at a blow.

JOHN GILPIN
Down ran the wine into the road,
Most piteous to be seen,
Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
As they had basted been.
But still he seem'd to carry weight,
With leathern girdle braced ;
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington These gambols he did play,
Until he came unto the Wash
Of Edmonton so gay ;
And there he threw the Wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop,
Or awild goose at play.
AtEdmonton his loving wife From the balcony spied Her tender husband, wondering much To see how he did ride.
"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! Here's the house ! "
They all at once did cry ;
"The dinner waits, and we are tired ;"
Said Gilpin, "So am I ! "
But yet his horse was not a whit Inclined to tarry there ;
For why ? his owner had a house Full ten miles off, at Ware.

JOHN GILPIN
So like an arrow swift he flew,
Shot by an archer strong;
So did he fly-which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Awaywent Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the Calender's
His horse at last stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbor in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him.
"What news? what news? your tidings tell !
Tell me you must and shallSay, why bare-headed you are come,
Orwhy you come at all?"
NowGilpin had apleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke;
And thus unto the Calender
In merry guise he spoke :
"I came, because your horse would come;
And, if I well forbode,
Myhat and wig will soon be here,
They are uponthe road."
The Calender, right glad to find His friend in merry pin,
Return'd him not asingle word,
But to the house went in;

JOHN GILPIN
Whence straight he came, with hat and wig,
Awig that flow'd behind ;
Ahat not much the worse for wear;
Each comely in its kind.
He held them up, and in his turn Thus show'd his ready wit :
"My head is twice as big as yours,
They therefore needs must fit.
"But let me scrape the dirt away,
That hangs upon your face;
And stop and eat, for well you may Be in ahungry case."
Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
And all the world would stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton,
And I should dine at Ware!"
So, turning to his horse, he said,
"I am in haste to dine;
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
You shall goback for mine."
Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!
For which he paid full dear;
For, while he spake, abraying ass Did sing most loud and clear;
Whereat his horse did snort, as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And ' gallop'd off with all his might,
Ashe had done before.

JOHN GILPIN
Awaywent Gilpin, and away Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
He lost them sooner than at first,
For why?-they were too big.
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw Her husband posting down Into the country far away,
She pull'd out half-a-crown ;
And thus unto the youth she said,
That drove them to the Bell,
"This shall be yours, when you bring back My husband safe and well. "
The youth did ride, and soon did meet John coming back amain;
Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
By catching at his rein;
But not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done,
The frighten'd steed he frighten'd more,
And made him faster run.
Away went Gilpin, and away Went postboy at his heels,
The postboy's horse right glad to miss
The lumbering of the wheels.
Six gentlemen upon the road Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With postboy scampering in the rear They raised the hue and cry:-

THE FLOWERS
"Stop thief !-stop thief !-a highwayman! "
Not one of them was mute ;
Andall and each that pass'd that way Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gates again Flew open in short space:
The toll-men thinking as before That Gilpin rode a race.
And so he did, and won it too!
Forhe got first to town;
Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
Hedid again get down.
-Now let us sing, Long live the King,
And Gilpin, long live he;
And, when he next doth ride abroad,
May I be there to see!

THE FLOWERS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
LL the names I know from nurse:
Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
And the Lady Hollyhock.
Fairy places, fairy things,
Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,
Tiny trees for tiny dames- These must all be fairy names !

THE DUEL
T
Tiny woods below whose boughs Shady fairies weave a house ;
Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
Where the braver fairies climb !
Fair are grown-up people's trees,
But the fairest woods are these ;
Where, if I were not so tall,
I should live for good and all.
THE DUEL
By Eugene Field
HE gingham dog and the calico cat Side by side on the table sat;
'Twas half-past twelve, and (what do you think! )
Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!
The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate Appeared to know as sure as fate There was going to be a terrible spat.
( I wasn't there; Isimply state
What was told me by the Chinese plate! )
The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"
Andthecalico cat replied "Mee-ow! "
The air was littered, an hour or so,
With bits of gingham and calico,
While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place
Up with its hands before its face,
For it always dreaded a family row!
(Now mind: I'm only telling you What the old Dutch clock declares is true!)

LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE
The Chinese plate looked very blue,
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do?"
But the gingham dog and the calico cat
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
Employing every tooth and claw In the awfullest way you ever saw- And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
(Don't fancy I exaggerate!
Igot my news from the Chinese plate! )
Next morning, where the two had sat,
They found no trace of dog or cat ;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away!
But the truth about the cat and pup Is this : they ate each other up!
Nowwhat do you really think of that!
( The old Dutch clock it told me so,
And that is how I came to know. )

READY FOR DUTY
By Anna B. Warner
AFFY-DOWN-DILLY came up in the
cold,
Through the brown mould,
Although the March breezes blew keen on her
face,
Although the white snow lay on many aplace.
Daffy-Down-Dilly had heard under ground The sweet, rushing sound
Of the streams, as they burst off their white winter
chainsOf the whistling spring winds, and the pattering
rains.
"Now then," thought Daffy, deep down in her heart,
"It's time I should start. "
So she pushed her soft leaves through the hard frozen ground,
Quite up to the surface and then she looked round.
There was snow all about her, gray clouds over- head;
The trees all looked dead:
Thenhow do you think Daffy-Down-Dilly felt,
When the sun would not shine, and the ice would
not melt?
Jun. Cl-10 131 5
THANATOPSIS
"Cold weather," thought Daffy, still working away;
"The earth's hard to-day;
There's but a half-inch of my leaves to be seen,
And two-thirds of that is more yellow than green.
"I can't do much yet, but I'll do what I can;
It's well I began;
For unless I can manage to lift up my head,
The people will think that Spring herself's dead."
So little by little she brought her leaves out,
All clustered about ;
And then her bright flowers began to unfold,
Till Daffy stood robed in her spring green and gold.
Oh, Daffy-Down-Dilly, so brave and so true!
I wish all were like you :
So ready for duty in all sorts of weather,
And showing forth courage and beauty together.

THANATOPSIS
By William Cullen Bryant
O him who, in the love of Nature, holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks Avarious language: for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty ; and she glides
Into his darker musings with a mild

THANATOPSIS
And gentle sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart,
Go forth under the open sky, and list
To Nature's teachings, while from all around- Earth and her waters, and the depths of airComes a still voice-Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course ; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix forever with the elements ;
To be a brother to the insensible rock,
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
Yet not to thine eternal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone-nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world-with kings,
The powerful of the earth-the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulcher. The hills,
Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales

THANATOPSIS
Stretching in pensive quietness between ;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
Inmajesty, and the complaining brooks,
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste- Arebut the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man! The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, traverse Barca's desert sands,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound Save his own dashings-yet the dead are there!
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep-the dead reign there alone !
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure ? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long
train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men- Theyouth in life's green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron and maid,

HEAVING OF THE LEAD
And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed manShall, one by one, be gathered to thy side Bythose who in their turn shall follow them.
So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
HEAVING OF THE LEAD
F
By Charles Dibdin
OR England when with favoring gale
Our gallant ship up channel steered,
And, scudding under easy sail,
The high blue western land appeared;
To heave the lead the seaman sprung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the deep-nine !"
Andbearing up to gain the port,
Some well-known object kept in view- An abbey- tower, a harbor-fort,
Or beacon to the vessel true;
While oft the lead the seaman flung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the mark-seven ! "

MORNING
B
And as the much-loved shore we near,
With transport we behold the roof
Where dwelt a friend or partner dear,
Of faith and love a matchless proof.
The lead once more the seaman flung,
And to the watchful pilot sung,
"Quarter less-five !"
Now to her berth the ship draws nigh :
We shorten sail-she feels the tide-
" Stand clear the cable" is the cryThe anchor's gone; we safely ride.. The watch is set, and through the night
Wehear the seamen with delight
Proclaim-"All's well! "
MORNING
By James Beattie
UT who the melodies of morn can tell?
The wild brook babbling down the mountain
side;
The lowing herd; the sheepfold's simple bell ;
The pipe of early shepherd dim descried
In the lone valley; echoing far and wide The clamorous horn along the cliffs above;
The hollow murmur of the ocean tide;
The hum of bees, the linnet's lay of love,
And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.
The cottage curs at early pilgrim bark;
Crowned with her pail the tripping milkmaid sings ;
The whistling ploughman stalks afield; and, hark !

THE CORAL GROVE
Down the rough slope the ponderous wagon rings;
Through rustling corn the hare astonished springs ;
Slow tolls the village-clock the drowsy hour ;
The partridge bursts away on whirring wings ;
Deep mourns the turtle in sequestered bower,
And shrill lark carols clear from her aerial tower.
D
THE CORAL GROVE
EEP in
By James Gates Percival
the wave is a coral grove,
Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove;
Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue
That never are wet with falling dew,
But in bright and changeful beauty shine Far down in the green and glassy brine.
The floor is of sand, like the mountain drift,
And the pearl-shells spangle the flinty snow;
From coral rocks the sea-plants lift
Their boughs, where the tides and billows flow;
The water is calm and still below,
For the winds and waves are absent there,
Andthe sands are bright as the stars that glow In the motionless fields of upper air.
There, with its waving blade of green,
The sea-flag streams through the silent water,
And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen
To blush, like a banner bathed in slaughter.
There, with a light and easy motion,
The fan-coral sweeps through the clear, deep sea ;
And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean
Are bending like corn on the upland lea,

THE JUMBLIES
And life, in rare and beautiful forms,
Is sporting amid those bowers of stone,
And is safe when the wrathful spirit of storms
Has made the top of the wave his own.
And when the ship from his fury flies,
Where the myriad voices of ocean roar,
When the wind-god frowns in the murky skies,
And demons are waiting the wreck on shore,
Then, far below, in the peaceful sea,
The purple mullet and gold-fish rove,
Where the waters murmur tranquilly,
Through the bending twigs of the coral grove.
THE JUMBLIES
By Edward Lear
HEY went to sea in THEY a sieve, they did,
sieve they went to sea:
In spite of all their friends could say,
On awinter's morn, on a stormy day,
In asieve they went to sea.
And when the sieve turned round and round,
Andevery one cried, "You'll all be drowned!"
They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big ;
But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:
In a sieve we'll go to sea!"
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.

THE JUMBLIES
They sailed awayin asieve, they did,
In a sieve they sailed so fast,
With only a beautiful pea-green veil Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,
To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
And every one said who saw them go,
"Oh! won't they be soon upset, you know?
For the sky is so dark, and the voyage is long;
And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong In a sieve to sail so fast."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
The water it soon came in, it did,
The water it soon came in;
So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
In a pinky paper all folded neat;
And they fastened it down with a pin.
And they passed the night in a crockery jar ;
And each of them said: "How wise we are!
Though the sky be dark and the voyage long Yet we never can think we were rash or
wrong,
While round in our sieve we spin."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.

THE JUMBLIES
And all night long they sailed away;
And when the sun went down,
They whistled and warbled a moony song
To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
In the shade of the mountains brown.
"O Timballoo! How happy we are
When we live in a sieve and a crockery jar!
And all night long, in the moonlight pale,
We sail away with a pea-green sail
In the shade of the mountains brown. "
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies
live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.
They sailed to the Western Sea, they did- To a land all covered with trees ;
And they bought an owl, and a useful cart,
And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,
And a hive of silvery bees ;
And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,
And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws.
And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,
And no end of Stilton cheese.
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies
live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.

THE MAN IN THE MOON
Andin twenty years they all came back- In twenty years or more ;
And every one said, "How tall they've grown!
For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible
Zone,
And the hills of the Chankly Bore."
And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast ;
And every one said, "If we only live,
We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,
To the hills of the Chankly Bore."
Far and few, far and few,
Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;
Their heads are green, and their hands
are blue,
And they went to sea in a sieve.

THE DINKEY-BIRD
By Eugene Field
N an ocean, 'way out yonder (As all sapient people know) ,
Is the land of Wonder-Wander,
Whither children love to go ;
It's their playing, romping, swinging,
That give great joy to me While the Dinkey-Bird goes singing In the amfalula tree.
There the gumdrops grow like cherries,
And taffy's thick as peas
Caramels you pick like berries
When, and where, and how you please;
Big red sugar-plums are clinging To the cliffs beside that sea
Where the Dinkey-Bird is singing
In the amfalula tree.
So when children shout and scamper And make merry all the day,
When there's naught to put a damper
To the ardor of their play;

HOLLYHOCK
When I hear their laughter ringing,
Then I'm sure as sure can be
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula tree.
For the Dinkey-Bird's bravuras
And staccatos are so sweetHis roulades, appoggiaturas,
And robustos so complete,
That the youth of every nationBe they near or far away- Have especial delectation
In that gladsome roundelay.
Their eyes grow bright and brighter,
Their lungs begin to crow,
Their hearts get light and lighter,
And their cheeks are all aglow;
For an echo cometh bringing
The news to all and me,
That the Dinkey-Bird is singing In the amfalula trec.

Has graced my garden-bed for years,
Sedately stiffened in a frock
All frills and ruffles to her ears ;
For at the fashions one may mock
When one is born a Hollyhock.

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Her gay companions creep and twine And riot in the summer breeze ;
But she doth haughtily decline To join in common sports like these ;
Such indecorum needs must shock
Awell-bred, well-starched Hollyhock.
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
H
By Robert Browning
AMELIN Town's in Brunswick,
By famous Hanover city;
The River Weser, deep and wide,
Washes its walls on the southern side;
Apleasanter spot you never spied ;
But, when begins my ditty,
Almost five hundred years ago,
To see the townsfolk suffer so,
From vermin, was a pity.
Rats!
They fought the dogs and killed the cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
Andeven spoiled the women's chats,
By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.

147
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
At last the people in a body To the Town Hall came flocking ;
" Tis clear," cried they, " our Mayor's a noddy ;
And as for our Corporation-shocking To think we buy gowns lined with ermine For dolts that can't or won't determine
What's best to rid us of our vermin !
You hope, because you're old and obese,
To find in the furry civic robe ease ?
Rouse up, sirs ! Give your brains a racking To find the remedy we're lacking,
Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing ! "
At this the Mayor and Corporation Quaked with a mighty consternation.
Anhour they sat in council ;
At length the Mayor broke silence ;
"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell ;
I wish I were a mile hence !
It's easy to bid one rack one's brainI'm sure my poor head aches again,
I've scratched it so, and all in vain.
Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap ! "
Just as he said this, what should hap At the chamber door, but a gentle tap ?
" Bless us ! " cried the Mayor, "what's that?"
(With the Corporation as he sat,
Looking little though wondrous fat ;
Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister
Than a too-long-opened oyster,
Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous For a plate of turtle green and glutinous.)
" Only a scraping of shoes on the mat ?

148
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Anything like the sound of a rat
Makes myheart go pit-a-pat !"
"Come in!" the Mayor cried, looking bigger,
And in did come the strangest figure!
His queer long coat, from heel to head Was half of yellow and half of red,
And he himself was tall and thin,
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,
And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,
But lips where smiles went out and in;
There was no guessing his kith and kin:
Andnobody could enough admire The tall man and his quaint attire.
Quoth one: "It's as if my great-grandsire,
Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,
Had walked this way from his painted tomb- stone!"
He advanced to the council table:
And, "Please your honors," said he, "I'm
able,
Bymeans of a secret charm, to draw All creatures living beneath the sun,
That creep, or swim, or fly, or run,
After me so as you never saw!
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm,
The mole, the toad, the newt, the viper;
And people call me the Pied Piper. "
(And here they noticed round his neck
Ascarf of red and yellow stripe 149
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
To match his coat of the selfsame cheque;
And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying As if impatient to be playing
Uponhis pipe, as low it dangled Over his vesture so old-fangled. )
"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am,
In Tartary I freed the Cham,
Last June, from his huge swarm of gnats;
I eased in Asia the Nizam
Of amonstrous brood of vampyre bats:
And as for what your brain bewilders,
If I can rid your town of rats Will you give me a thousand guilders?"
"One? fifty thousand! "-was the exclamation
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
Into the street the Piper stept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept In his quiet pipe the while;
Then, like a musical adept,
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,
Andgreenandblue his sharp eyes twinkled,
Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
Andere three shrill notes the pipehad uttered,
You heard as if an army muttered ;
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumb- ling;
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails, and pricking whiskers,
Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wivesFollowed the Piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped, advancing,
And step for step they followed dancing,
Until they came to the River Weser,
Wherein all plunged and perished!
-Save one, who stood as Julius Cæsar,
Swam across and lived to carry
(As he, the manuscript he cherished)
To Rat-land home his commentary :
Which was, "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,
Iheard a sound as of scraping tripe,
And putting apples, wondrous ripe,
Into a cider-press's gripe :
Andmoving away of pickle-tub boards,
And aleaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,
And adrawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,
Andabreaking the hoops of butter-casks:
And it seemed as if a voice
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice !
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'
Andjust as a bulky sugar-puncheon,
All ready staved, like agreat sun shone Glorious, scarce an inch before me,
Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore mel -Ifound the Weser rolling o'er me."

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
You should have heard the Hamelin people Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.
"Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles,
Poke out the nests, and block up the holes!
Consult with carpenters and builders,
And leave in our town not even a trace
Of the rats ! " When suddenly, up the face Of the Piper perked in the market-place,
With a, "First, if you please, my thousand guilders !"
Athousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;
So did the Corporation, too.
For council dinners made rare havoc
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;
And half the money would replenish Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.
To pay this sum to awandering fellow,
With agypsy coat of red andyellow!
"Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,
"Our business was done at the river's brink;
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.
So friend, we're not the folks to shrink From the duty of giving you something to drink,
And a matter of money to put in your poke;
But, as for the guilders, what we spoke Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty.
thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
The Piper's face fell, and he cried,
"No trifling ! I can't wait, beside!
I've promised to visit by dinner-time
Bagdad, and accept the prime Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,
For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,
Of a nest of scorpions no survivor :
With him I proved no bargain-driver,
With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver !
And folks who put me in a passion
May find me pipe after another fashion."
"How! " cried the Mayor, "d'ye think I'll brook Being worse treated than a cook?
Insulted by a lazy ribald
With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,
Blow your pipe there till you burst !"
Once more he stept into the street,
And to his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
Never gave the enraptured air )
There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling Ofmerry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering.
And, like fowls in a farmyard whenbarley is scat.
tering,
Out came the children running.
And all the little boys and girls,

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood As if they were changed into blocks of wood,
Unable to move a step, or cry To the children merrily skipping by,
-Could only follow with the eye
That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
And now the Mayor was on the rack,
And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,
As the Piper turned from the High Street
To where the Weser rolled its waters
Right in the way of their sons and daughters !
However, he turned from south to west,
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,
And after him the children pressed;
Great was the joy in every breast.
"Henever can cross that mighty top !
He's forced to let the piping drop,
And we shall see our children stop !"
When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,
Awondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,
Andwhen all were in to the very last,
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
Did I say all? No! One was lame,
Andcould not dance the whole of the way;
And in after years, if you would blame His sadness, he was used to say154
THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!
I can't forget that I'm bereft Of all the pleasant sights they see,
Which the Piper also promised me.
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,
Joining the town and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
Andeverything was strange and new;
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks
here,
And their dogs outran our fallow deer,
Andhoney-bees had lost their stings,
And horses were born with eagles' wings;
And just as I became assured Mylame foot would be speedily cured,
The music stopped, and I stood still,
Andfound myself outside the hill,
Left alone against my will,
To go now limping as before,
And never hear of that country more!"
Alas, alas for Hamelin!
There came into many aburgher's pate A text which says that heaven's gate Opes to the rich at as easy rate As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
The Mayor sent East, West, North and South,
To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,
Wherever it was man's lot to find him,
Silver and gold to his heart's content,
If he'd only return the way he went,
Andbring the children behind him,

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,
And Piper and dancers were gone forever,
They made a decree that lawyers never Should think their records dated duly
If, after the day of the month and the year,
These words did not as well appear :
"And so long after what happened here
On the Twenty-second of July,
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six."
And the better in memory to fix
The place of the children's last retreat,
They called it the Pied Piper's StreetWhere any one playing on pipe or tabor Was sure for the future to lose his labor.
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
But opposite the place of the cavern
They wrote the story on a column,
And on the great church-window painted
The same, to make the world acquainted How their children were stolen away,
And there it stands to this very day.
And I must not omit to say
That in Transylvania there's a tribe
Of alien people who ascribe The outlandish ways and dress On which their neighbors lay such stress,
To their fathers and mothers having risen
Out of some subterraneous prison Into which they were trepanned Long ago in amighty band Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,
But how or why, they don't understand.

WAITING AROUND
So, Willy, let you and me be wipers Of scores out with all men-especially pipers !
And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,
If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!
WAITING AROUND
By Burges Johnson
T was awful long ago That I put those seeds around;
And I guess I ought to know
When I stuck 'em in the ground.
'Cause I noted down the day
In a little diary book- It's gotten losted somewheres, and
I don't know where to look.
But I'm certain anyhow,
They've been planted 'most a week;
And it must be time by now For their little sprouts to peek.
They've been watered every day With a very speshul care,
And once or twice I've dug 'em up, to
See if they was there.
Ifixed the dirt in humps,
Just the way they said I should;
And I crumbled all the lumps
Just as finely as I could.

WISHING
And I found an angle-worm A-poking up his headHe maybe feeds on seeds and such,
And so I squashed him dead.
A seed's so very small ;
And dirt all looks the sameHow can they know at all The way they ought to aim?
And so I'm waiting 'round
In case of any need;
Afarmer ought to do his best for
Every single seed!
WISHING
By William Allingham
ING- TING! RING I wish I were a Primrose,
A bright yellow Primrose, blowing in the spring!
The stooping boughs above me,
The wandering bee to love me,
The fern and moss to creep across,
And the Elm-tree for our king!
Nay-stay! I wish I were an Elm-tree,
Agreat, lofty Elm-tree, with green leaves gay!
The winds would set them dancing,
The sun and moonshine glance in,
The birds would house among the boughs,
And sweetly sing.

A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
Oh-no! I wish I were a Robin,
ARobin or a little Wren, everywhere to go;
Through forest, field, or garden,
And ask no leave or pardon,
Till winter comes with icy thumbs To ruffle up our wing!
Well-tell! Where should I fly to,
Where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell?
Before a day was over,
Home comes the rover,
For mother's kiss-sweeter this
Than any other thing.
ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY
CHURCHYARD
T
By Thomas Gray
HE curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight Anddrowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower The moping owl does to the moon complain Ofsuch as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade
Whereheavesthe turf inmany amouldering heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn
Or busy housewife ply her evening care :
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
Howjocund did they drive their team afield !
Howbow'd thewoods beneath their sturdystroke !
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the Poor.
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:-
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted
vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise,

A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
Can storied urn or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honor's voice provoke the silent dust
Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?
Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire ;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre :
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er enroll ;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.
Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear :
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
Some village- Hampden, that with dauntless breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.
Th' applause of listening senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their history in a nation's eyes
Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined ;
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind ;

A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.
Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.
Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture
deck'd,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply:
Andmany aholy text around she strews,
That teach the rustic moralist to die.
For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?
On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires ;
E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.

A CHURCHYARD ELEGY
For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonor'd dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate ;
If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fateHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,
Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;
There at the foot of yonder nodding beech That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noon-tide would he stretch,
Andpore upon the brook that babbles by.
Hard by yonwood, now smiling as in scorn,
Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove ;
Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,
Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.
One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
Along the heath, and near his favorite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;
The next with dirges due in sad array Slow through the church-way path we saw him borneApproach and read (for thou canst read) the
lay Graved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn.

CROCUS
The Epitaph
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth Ayouth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere ;
Heavendid a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heaven ( 'twas all he wish'd) a
friend.
No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose, )
The bosom of his Father and his God.

CROCUS
By Sarah J. Day
THE Crocus had slept in his little round house
So soundly the whole winter through;
There came a tap-tapping-'twas spring at the door:
"Up! up ! we are waiting for you!"
The Crocus peeped out from his little brown house
And nodded his gay little head;
"Good-morning, Miss Snowdrop! and how do you
do
This fine, chilly morning?" he said.

TO A WATERFOWL
By William Cullen Bryant
WHITHER While glow, the midst heavens fallingwithdewthe last steps
of day,
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue Thy solitary way?
Vainly the fowler's eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.
Seek'st thou the plashy brink
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean side?
There is a Power whose care
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,
The desert and illimitable airLone wandering, but not lost.
All day thy wings have fanned,
Atthat far height, the cold thin atmosphere,
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.
And soon that toil shall end;
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,
Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.

THE BROWN THRUSH
Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.
He who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone
Will lead my steps aright.

THE BROWN THRUSH
By Lucy Larcom
HERE'S amerry brown thrush sitting up in
the tree-
"He's singing to me! He's singing to me!"
Andwhat does he say, little girl, little boy?
"Oh, the world's running over with joy!
Don't you hear? don't you see?
Hush! Look! In my tree,
I'm as happy as happy can be!"
And the brown thrush keeps singing, "Anest do
you see,
And five eggs hid by mein the juniper-tree?
Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,
Or the world will lose some of its joy!
Now I'm glad! now I'm free!
And I always shall be,
If you never bring sorrow to me."

THE BLUE JAY
So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,
To you and to me, to you and to me;
Andhe sings all the day, little girl, little boy,
"Oh, the world's running over with joy;
But long it won't be,
Don't you know? don't you see?
Unless we are as good as can be?"

THE BLUE JAY
By Susan Hartley Swett
BLUE JAY up in the maple tree,
Shaking your throat with such bursts of glee,
How did you happen to be so blue?
Did you steal a bit of the lake for your crest,
And fasten blue violets into your vest?
Tell me, I pray you tell me true!
Did you dip your wings in azure dye,
When April began to paint the sky,
That was pale with the winter's stay?
Orwere you hatched from ablue bell bright,
'Neath the warm, gold breast of a sunbeam light,
Bythe river one blue spring day?
O Blue Jay up in the maple tree,
Atossing your saucy head at me,
With ne'er a word for my questioning,
Pray, cease for amoment your "ting-a-link,"
Andhear when I tell you what I thinkYou bonniest bit of the spring.

THE BLUEBIRD
I think when the fairies made the flowers,
To grow in these mossy fields of ours,
Periwinkles and violets rare,
There was left of the spring's own color, blue,
Plenty to fashion a flower whose hue
Would be richer than all and as fair.
So, putting their wits together, they Made one great blossom so bright and gay,
The lily beside it seemed blurred;
And then they said, "Wewill toss it in air ;
So many blue blossoms grow everywhere,
Let this pretty one be a bird!"

THE BLUEBIRD
By Emily Huntington Miller
KNOW the song that the bluebird is singing,
Out in the apple-tree where he is swinging,
Brave little fellow ! the skies may be drearyNothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.
Hark! how the music leaps out from his throat !
Hark! was there ever so merry a note?
Listen awhile, and you'll hear what he's saying,
Up in the apple-tree swinging and swaying :
"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,
You must be weary of winter, I know;
Hark while I sing you a message of cheer:
Summer is coming! and spring-time is here!

THE NIGHTINGALE
"Little white snow-drop! I pray you arise ;
Bright yellow crocus! come, open your eyes ;
Sweet little violets, hid from the cold,
Put on your mantles of purple and gold;
Daffodils ! daffodils! say, do you hear ?-
Summer is coming! and spring-time is here!"
THE NIGHTINGALE AND
GLOW- WORM
A
By William Cowper
NIGHTINGALE, that all day long Had cheered the village with his song,
Nor yet at eve his note suspended,
Nor yet when eventide was ended,
Began to feel as well he mightThe keen demands of appetite ;
When, looking eagerly around,
He spied, far off, upon the ground,
Asomething shining in the dark,
Andknew the glow-wormby his spark;
So, stooping down from hawthorn top,
He thought to put him in his crop.
The worm, aware of his intent,
Harangued him thus, quite eloquent- "Did you admire my lamp," quoth he,
"As much as Iyour minstrelsy,
You would abhor to do me wrong,
As much as I to spoil your song;
For ' twas the self-same Power divine
Taught you to sing, and me to shine;

THE LARK AND THE ROOK
That you with music, I with light,
Might beautify and cheer the night. "
The songster heard his short oration,
And, warbling out his approbation,
Released him, as my story tells,
And found a supper somewhere else.

But not to sleep on the cold, damp ground.
The fittest place for abird like me

"I opened my eyes at peep of day And saw you taking your upward way,
Dreaming your fond romantic dreams,

Soaring too high to be seen or heard;

I looked and wondered-good-night, poor thing!"
"Good night, once more," said the lark's sweet voice.

But is your slumber more sweet than mine?
You make more noise in the world than I,

ROBERT OF LINCOLN
By William Cullen Bryant
ERRILY swinging on brier and weed,
Near to the nest of his little dame,
Over the mountain-side or mead,
Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Snug and safe is this nest of ours,
Hidden among the summer flowers.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln is gayly dressed,
Wearing a bright, black wedding-coat ;
White are his shoulders, and white his crest,
Hear him call in his merry note,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Look what a nice, new coat is mine;
Sure there was never abird so fine.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,
Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,
Passing at home a patient life,
Broods in the grass while her husband sings Bob-o'-link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Brood, kind creature, you need not fear Thieves and robbers while I am here.
Chee, chee, chee.

Modest and shy as a nun is she ;
One weak chirp is her only note ;
Braggart, and prince of braggarts is he,
Pouring boasts from his little throat,
Bob-o' - link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Never was I afraid of man,
Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.
Chee, chee, chee.
Six white eggs on abed of hay,
Flecked with purple, apretty sight :
There as the mother sits all day,
Robert is singing with all his might,
Bob-o'-link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Nice good wife that never goes out,
Keeping house while I frolic about.
Chee, chee, chee.
Soon as the little ones chip the shell,
Six wide mouths are open for food ;
Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,
Gathering seeds for the hungry brood.
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
This new life is likely to be
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.
Chee, chee, chee.
Robert of Lincoln at length is made
Sober with work, and silent with care,

Off is his holiday garment laid,
Half forgotten that merry air,
Bob-o' -link, bob-o' -link,
Spink, spank, spink,
Nobody knows but my mate and I,
Where our nest and our nestlings lie.
Chee, chee, chee.
Summer wanes; the children are grown;
Fun and frolic no more he knows,
Robert of Lincoln's a hum-drum drone;
Off he flies, and we sing as he goes,

Spink, spank, spink,
Whenyou can pipe that merry old strain,
Robert of Lincoln, come back again.

The daisies have shut up their sleepy red eyes,
And the bees and the birds are at rest.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away home:
The glow-worm is lighting her lamp,
The dew's falling fast, and your fine speckled wings Will flag with the close-clinging damp.

GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
Lady-bird ! lady-bird ! fly away home- Good luck if you reach it at last !
The owl's come abroad, and the bat's on the roam,
Sharp set from their Ramazan fast.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeThe fairy bells tinkle afar !
Make haste, or they'll catch you, and harness you
fast
With a cobweb to Oberon's car.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away homeTo your house in the old willow-tree,
Where your children so dear have invited the ant
And a few cosy neighbors to tea.
Lady-bird! lady-bird! fly away home,
And if not gobbled up by the way,
Nor yoked by the fairies to Oberon's car,
You're in luck-and that's all I've to say.

Catching your heart up at the feel of June Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon
Wheneven the bees lag at the summoning brass ;

With those who think the candles come too soon,
Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune
Nick the glad silent moments as they pass !

O sweet and tiny cousins, that belong,
One to the fields, the other to the hearth,

To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song- In doors and out, summer and winter, mirth.

ASILLY Throughyoung the cricket warm,, accustomed sunny months to singgay
summer and spring,
Began to complain, whenhe found that at home
His cupboard was empty and winter was come.
Not a crumb to be found
On the snow-covered ground;
Not a flower could he see,
Not a leaf on a tree :
"Oh, what will become," says the cricket, "of me? "
At last, by starvation and famine made bold,
All dripping with wet and all trembling with cold,
Awayhe set off to a miserly ant,
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant Him shelter from rain;
Amouthful of grain
He wished only to borrow,
He'd repay it to-morrow ;
If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.

THE HOUSEKEEPER
Says the ant to the cricket, "I'm your servant and
friend,
But we ants never borrow, we ants never lend;
But tell me, dear sir, did you lay nothing by When the weather was warm?" Said the cricket,
Not I.
My heart is so light
That I sang day and night,
For all nature looked gay"-
"You sang, sir, you say?
Gothen," said the ant, "and dance winter away."
Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Though this is afable, the moral is good:
If you live without work, you must live without food.

THE HOUSEKEEPER
By Charles Lamb
HE frugal snail, with forecast of repose,
Carries his house with him where'er he goes ;
Peeps out-and if there comes a shower of rain,
Retreats to his small domicile again.
Touch but a tip of him, a horn-'tis wellHe curls up inhis sanctuary Shell,
He's his own landlord, his own tenant; stay
Long as he will, he dreads no Quarter Day.
Himself he boards and lodges; both invites And feasts himself; sleeps with himself o' nights

GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
He spares the upholsterer trouble to procure
Chattels ; himself is his own furniture,
Andhis sole riches. Wheresoe'er he roamKnock whenyou will he's sure to be at home.

SONG
By Alfred Tennyson
CHE winds, as at their hour of birth,
Leaning upon the ridged sea,
Breathed low around the rolling earth
With the mellow preludes, "We are free,"
The streams through many a lilied row
Down-carolling to the crisped sea,
Low-tinkled with abell-like flow
Atween the blossoms, "We are free."
THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET
T
By John Keats
HE poetry of earth is never dead;
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun
Andhide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mownmead.
That is the grasshopper's he takes the lead In summer luxury-he has never done
With his delights ; for, when tired out with fun,
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never.

THE KITTEN
Onalone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought asilence, from the stove there shrills The cricket's song, inwarmth increasing ever,
And seems, to one in drowsiness half lost,
The grasshopper's among some grassy hills.
KEEPING STORE
By Mary F. Butts
WEhavebags and bags Ehave bags and bags of whitest down
Out of the milk-weed pods;
Wehave purple asters in lovely heaps,
And stacks of golden-rods.
Wehave needles out of the sweet pine woods,
Andspools of cob-web thread;
Wehavebachelor's buttons for dolly's dress,
Andhollyhock caps for her head.
THE KITTEN, AND FALLING LEAVES
By William Wordsworth
EE the kitten on the wall,that fall,
Withered leaves-one-two-and threeFrom the lofty elder tree!
Through the calm and frosty air
Of this morning bright and fair,
Eddying round and round they sink Softly, slowly: one might think,

WHAT THE WIND BRINGS
From the motions that are made,
Every little leaf conveyed Sylph or fairy hither tending- To this lower world descending,
Each invisible and mute,
In his wavering parachute.
But the kitten, how she starts !
Crouches, stretches, paws and darts!
First at one, and then its fellow,
Just as light and just as yellow ;
There are many now-now oneNow they stop and there are none.
What intenseness of desire
In her upward eye of fire!
With a tiger-leap, half-way Now she meets the coming prey;
Lets it go as fast, and then
Has it in her power again:
Now she works with three or four,
Like an Indian conjuror;
Quick as he in feats of art,
Far beyond in joy of heart.
WHAT THE WIND BRINGS
By Edmund Clarence Stedman
is the wind that brings the cold? WHICH The North is the- Wind wind, Freddy, and all the
snow;
And the sheep will scamper into the fold When the North begins to blow.

THE WIND
Which is the wind that brings the heat?
The South- Wind, Katy; and corn will grow,
And peaches redden for you to eat,
When the South begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the rain?
The East-Wind, Arty; and farmers know The cows come shivering up the lane When the East begins to blow.
Which is the wind that brings the flowers?
The West- Wind, Bessy; and soft and low
The birdies sing in the summer hours,
When the West begins to blow.

THE WIND
By Robert Louis Stevenson
SAWyou toss the kites on high Andblow the birds about the sky ;
And all around I heard you pass,
Like ladies' skirts across the grassOwind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!
I saw the different things you did,
But always you yourself you hid.
I felt you push, I heard you call,
Icould not see yourself at all- Owind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud asong!

WIND-SONG
O you that are so strong and cold,
O blower are you young or old?
Are you a beast of field and tree,
Or just a stronger child than me?
O wind, a-blowing all day long,
Owind, that sings so loud a song!
WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND
W
By Christina G. Rossetti
HO has seen the wind?
Neither I nor you:
But when the leaves hang trembling,
The wind is passing through.
Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor I:
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by.
WIND-SONG
By Nora Hopper
BLOWmerry- , blow, winds blow,braggartwinds and
Blow down the almond snow, toss the flowering
cherry.
Daffodils ablow, arow, mingle intheir dances,
Shake the purple flags that grow tall amid their
lances.
Blow, O winds blow, strip the winter-berry!

WINDY NIGHTS
Far and near, push and peer, here's a nest a
growing- Winds merry, winds dear, hush here your blowing!
Trouble not the mother-wren when she comes and
goes,
Dreaming of the wings and songs that her secret knowsSoft here, winds dear, where the nests are showing.
Blow, blow loud and low, wild winds and merry,
Hurtling down upon our heads bring a snow of
cherry.
Bring the yellow kingcups out in the flowerless
places,
Set the naked woods aflush with the wind-flowers'
faces.
Make the old briar run with sap ready for the berry,
Bring the swallows, April follows, wild winds and
merry.
WINDY NIGHTS
By Robert Louis Stevenson
HENEVERthe moon and starsareset,
Whenever the wind is high,
All night long in the dark and wet,
Amangoes riding by.
Late in the night when the fires are out,
Whydoes he gallop and gallop about?

THE WIND AND THE MOON
Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
And ships are tossed at sea,
By, on the highway, low and loud,
By at the gallop goes he.
By at the gallop he goes, and then
By he comes back at the gallop again.
THE WIND AND THE MOON
By George MacDonald
AID the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out!
You stare
In the air
As if crying 'Beware,'
Always looking what I am about :
I hate to be watched; I will blow you out !
The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.
So, deep
On a heap
Of clouds, to sleep,
Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon,
Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon!"
He turned in his bed: she was there again!
Onhigh
In the sky,
With her one ghost-eye The Moon shone white and alive and plain:
Said the Wind, "I will blow you out again!"

THE WIND AND THE MOON
The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew slim.
"With my sledge
And my wedge
I have knocked off her edge !
Iwill blow," said the Wind, "right fierce and grim,
And the creature will soon be slimmer than slim!"
He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread.
"One puff
More's enough
To blow her to snuff !
One good puff more where the last was bred,
Andglimmer, glimmer, glum will go that thread!"
Heblew a great blast, and the thread wasgone.
In the air
Nowhere
Was a moonbeam bare ;
Larger and nearer the shy stars shone :
Sure and certain the Moon was gone!
The Wind he took to his revels once more ;
On down
Andin town,
A merry-mad clown,
He leaped and holloed with whistle and roarWhenthere was that glimmering thread once more!
He flew in a rage-he danced and blew ;
But in vain
Was the pain
Of his bursting brain,
For still the Moon-scrap the broader grew
The more that he swelled his big cheeks andblew.

SLEIGH SONG
Slowly she grew-till she filled the night,
And shone
On her throne
In the sky alone,
Amatchless, wonderful, silvery light,
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.
Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I !
With mybreath,
Ingood faith,
I blew her to death!
First blew her away right out of the sky,
Then blew her in: what a strength am I!"
But the Moon she knew naught of the silly affair;
For, high In the sky,
With her one white eye,
Motionless miles above the air,
She never had heard the great Windblare.

SLEIGH SONG
By G. W. Pettee
INGLE, jingle, clear the way,
'Tis the merry, merry sleigh,
As it swiftly scuds along
Hear the burst of happy song,
See the gleam of glances bright,
Flashing o'er the pathway white.
Jingle, jingle, past it flies,

COME, LITTLE LEAVES
Sending shafts from hooded eyes,
Roguish archers, I'll be bound,
Little heeding who they wound;
See them, with capricious pranks,
Ploughing now the drifted banks;
Jingle, jingle, mid the glee
Who among them cares for me?
Jingle, jingle, on they go,
Capes and bonnets white with snow,
Not a single robe they fold To protect them from the cold;
Jingle, jingle, mid the storm,
Fun and frolic keep them warm;
Jingle, jingle, down the hills,
O'er the meadows, past the mills,
Now 'tis slow, and now 'tis fast;
Winter will not always last.
Jingle, jingle, clear the way,
'Tis the merry, merry sleigh.
COME, LITTLE LEAVES
"COME,
ByGeorge Cooper
OME, little Leaves," said the Wind one day,
"Come over the meadows with me and play;
Put on your dresses of red and gold,
For summer is gone and the days grow cold."
Soon as the Leaves heard the Wind's loud call,
Down they came fluttering, one and all;
Over the brown fields they danced and flew,
Singing the sweet little song they knew:

SEVEN TIMES ONE
"Cricket, good-by, we've been friends so long ;
Little brook, sing us your farewell song;
Say you are sorry to see us go;
Ah, you will miss us, right well we know.
"Dear little lambs in your fleecy fold,
Mother will keep you from harm and cold ;
Fondly we watched you in vale and glade,
Say, will you dream of our loving shade?"
Dancing and whirling, the little Leaves went,
Winter had called them, and they were content ;
Soon, fast asleep in their earthy beds,
The snow laid a coverlid over their heads.

SEVEN TIMES ONE
By Jean Ingelow
HERE'S no dew left on the daisies and clover ;
There's no rain left in heaven;
I've said my"seven times" over and over- Seven times one are seven.
I am old! so old I can write a letter ;
My birthday lessons are done:
The lambs play always, they know no better ;
They are only one times one.
OMoon! in the night I have seen you sailing,
And shining so round and low;
You were bright! ah, bright! but your light is failing;
You are nothing now but abow.

A PITCHER OF MIGNONETTE
You Moon! have you done something wrong in
heaven,
That God has hidden your face?
I hope if you have, you will soonbe forgiven,
And shine again in your place.
O velvet Bee! you're a dusty fellow,
You've powdered your legs with gold;
O brave marsh Mary-buds, rich and yellow!
Give me your money to hold.
O Columbine! open your folded wrapper Where two twin turtle-doves dwell;
O Cuckoo-pint! toll me the purple clapper,
That hangs in your clear, green bell.
Andshow me your nest with the young ones in it I will not steal them away,
Iam old! you may trust me, Linnet, Linnet- I am seven times one to-day.

PITCHER of mignonette,

Queer sort of flower-pot-yet
That pitcher of mignonette Is a garden in heaven set,
To the little sick child inthe basement
The pitcher of mignonette,
In the tenement's highest casement.

SIGNS OF RAIN
By Dr. Edward Jenner
Forty Reasons for Not Accepting an Invitation of a Frien to Make an Excursion With Him
1 THE hollow winds begin to blow ;
2 The clouds look black, the glass is low,
3 The soot falls down, the spaniels sleep,
4 And spiders from their cobwebs peep.
5 Last night the sun went pale to bed,
6 The moon in halos hid her head;
7 The boding shepherd heaves a sigh,
8 For see a rainbow spans the sky.
9 The walls are damp, the ditches smell,
10 Closed is the pink-eyed pimpernel.
11 Hark how the chairs and tables crack !
12 Old Betty's nerves are on the rack;
13 Loud quacks the duck, the peacocks cry,
14 The distant hills are seeming nigh.
15 How restless are the snorting swine!
16 The busy flies disturb the kine;
17 Low o'er the grass the swallow wings,
18 The cricket, too, how sharp he sings,
19 Puss on the hearth, with velvet paws,
20 Sits wiping o'er her whiskered jaws,
21 Through the clear streams the fishes rise,
22 And nimbly catch the incautious flies.
23 The glow-worms, numerous and light,
24 Illumed the dewy dell last night,
25 At dusk the squalid toad was seen,
26 Hopping and crawling o'er the green,
27 The whirling dust the wind obeys,

A BOY'S SONG
28 And in the rapid eddy plays ;
29 The frog has changed his yellow vest,
30 And in a russet coat is dressed.
31 Though June, the air is cold and still,
32 The mellow blackbird's voice is shrill;
33 My dog, so altered in his taste,
34 Quits mutton-bones on grass to feast",
35 And see yon rooks, how odd their flight.
36 They imitate the gliding kite,
37 And seem precipitate to fall,
38 As if they felt the piercing ball.
39 'Twill surely rain; I see with sorrow,
40 Our jaunt must be put off to-morrow.
A BOY'S SONG
By James Hogg
WHERE Where thethegray poolstrout arebright lies asleep and, deep,
Up the river and o'er the lea,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Where the blackbird sings the latest,
Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,
Where the nestlings chirp and flee,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Where the mowers mow the cleanest,
Where the hay lies thick and greenest;
There to trace the homeward bee,
That's the way for Billy and me.

FARM- YARD SONG
Where the hazel bank is steepest,
Where the shadow falls the deepest,
Where the clustering nuts fall free,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Why the boys should drive away
Little sweet maidens from the play,
Or love to banter and fight so well,
That's the thing I never could tell.
But this I know, I love to play,
Through the meadow, among the hay;
Up the water and o'er the lea,
That's the way for Billy and me.

FARM- YARD SONG
By J. T. Trowbridge
VER the hill the farm-boy goes,
His shadow lengthens along the land,
A giant staff in a giant hand ;
In the poplar-tree, above the spring,
The katydid begins to sing ;
The early dews are falling;-
Into the stone-heap darts the mink ;
The swallows skim the river's brink ;
And home to the woodland fly the crows,
When over the hill the farm-boy goes,
Cheerily calling- "Co', boss ! co', boss ! co' ! co' ! co' ! "

FARM- YARD SONG
Farther, farther over the hill,
Faintly calling, calling still- " Co' , boss ! co', boss ! co' ! co' ! "
Into the yard the farmer goes,
With grateful heart, at the close of day ;
Harness and chain are hung away ;
In the wagon-shed stand yoke and plow ;
The straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow;
The cooling dews are falling ;-
The friendly sheep his welcome bleat,
The pigs come grunting to his feet,
The whinnying mare her master knows,
When into the yard the farmer goes,
His cattle calling- " Co' , boss ! co' , boss ! co' ! co' ! co' ! "
While still the cow-boy, far away,
Goes seeking those that have gone astray- " Co' , boss ! co' , boss ! co' ! co' ! "
Now to her task the milkmaid goes.
The cattle come crowding through the gate,
Lowing, pushing, little and great ;
About the trough, by the farm-yard pump,
The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump,
While the pleasant dews are falling ;-
The new-milch heifer is quick and shy,
But the old cow waits with tranquil eye;
And the white stream into the bright pail flows,
When to her task the milkmaid goes,
Soothingly calling- "So, boss ! so, boss ! so ! so ! so ! "

THE MILKMAID
The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool,
And sits and milks in the twilight cool,
Saying, " So ! so, boss ! so ! so! "
To supper at last the farmer goes.
The apples are pared, the paper read,
The stories are told, then all to bed.
Without, the crickets' ceaseless song
Makes shrill the silence all night long ;
The heavy dews are falling.
The housewife's hand has turned the lock;
Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock ;
The household sinks to deep repose ;
But still in sleep the farm-boy goes.
Singing, calling- "Co' , boss ! co' , boss ! co' ! co' ! co' ! "
And oft the milkmaid in her dreams,
Drums in the pail with the flashing streams,
Murmuring, "So, boss! so ! "
A
THE MILKMAID
By Jeffreys Taylor
MILKMAID, who poised a full pail on her
head,
Thus mused onher prospects in life, it is said :
" Let me see-I should think that this milk will
procure Onehundred good eggs, or fourscore, to be sure.
"Well then-stop a bit-it must not be forgotten,
Some of these may be broken, and some may be
rotten ;

THE MILKMAID
But if twenty for accident should be detached,
It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to be hatched.
"Well, sixty sound eggs-no, sound chickens, I
mean:
Of these some may die-we'll suppose seventeen,
Seventeen! not so many-say ten at the most,
Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast.
"But then there's their barley: how much will they
need?
Why, they take but one grain at atime when they feedSo that's a mere trifle ; now then, let us see,
At a fair market price how much money there'll be.
" Six shillings a pair-five-four-three-and-six,
To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix ;
Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said- Fifty times three-and-sixpence-I'll ask Brother Ned.
"O, but
'em;
stop-three-and-sixpence apair I must sell
Well, a pair is a couple-now then let us tell 'em;
Acouple in fifty will go (mypoorbrain!)
Why, just a score times, and five pair will remain.
"Twenty- five pairs of fowls-now how tiresome
it is
That I can't reckon up so much money as this !
Well, there's no use in trying, so let's give a guess- I'll say twenty pounds, and it can't be no less.

HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD
"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,
Thirty geese, and two turkeys-eight pigs and a
Sow;
Nowif these turn out well, at the end of the year,
I shall fill both my pockets with guineas, 'tis clear."
Forgetting her burden, when this she had said,
The maid superciliously tossed up her head;
When, alas for her prospects! her milk-pail de- scended,
And so all her schemes for the future were ended.
This moral, I think, may be safely attached- "Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatched."
HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD
By Henry W. Longfellow
Ythe shores of B
Gitche Gumee,
By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
Dark behind it rose the forest,
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
Rose the firs with cones upon them;
Bright before it beat the water,
Beat the clear and sunny water,
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.
There the wrinkled old Nokomis
Nursed the little Hiawatha,
Rocked him in his linden cradle,

HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,
Safely bound with reindeer sinews ;
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,
"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"
Lulled him into slumber, singing,
"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!
Who is this that lights the wigwam?
Withhis great eyes lights the wigwam?
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"
Many things Nokomis taught him Of the stars that shine in heaven;
Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,
Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses ;
Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,
Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,
Flaring far away to northward
In the frosty nights of winter;
Showed the broad, white road in heaven,
Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,
Running straight across the heavens,
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.
At the door, on summer evenings,
Sat the little Hiawatha;
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,
Heard the lapping of the water,
Sounds of music, words of wonder;
"Minnie-wawa!" said the pine-trees,
"Mudway-aushka! " said the water;
Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,
Flitting through the dusk of evening,
With the twinkle of its candle

HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,
And he sang the song of children,
Sang the song Nokomis taught him:
"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,
Little, flitting, white-fire insect,
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,
Light me with your little candle,
Ere upon my bed I lay me,
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids !"
Saw the moon rise from the water
Rippling, rounding from the water,
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"
Andthe good Nokomis answered:
"Once a warrior, very angry,
Seized his grandmother, and threw her
Up into the sky at midnight ;
Right against the moon he threw her ;
'Tis her body that you see there."
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,
In the eastern sky, the rainbow,
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis ?"
And the good Nokomis answered :
" Tis the heaven of flowers you see there ;
All the wild-flowers of the forest,
All the lilies of the prairie,
Whenon earth they fade and perish,
Blossom in that heaven above us."
Whenhe heard the owls at midnight,
Hooting, laughing in the forest,
;
:

SEVEN TIMES TWO
"What is that?" he cried in terror ;
"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"
And the good Nokomis answered:
"That is but the owl and owlet,
Talking in their native language,
Talking, scolding at each other."
Then the little Hiawatha
Learned of every bird its language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How they built their nests in summer,
Where they hid themselves in winter,
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."
Of all beasts he learned the language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How the beavers built their lodges,
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,
Why the rabbit was so timid,
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers. "

SEVEN TIMES TWO
ON bells
By Jean Ingelow
in the steeple, ring out your changes,
How many soever they be,
Andlet the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges
Come over, come over to me.

SEVEN TIMES TWO
Yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling No magical sense conveys,
Andbells have forgotten their old art of telling
The fortune of future days.
" Turn again, turn again, " once they rang cheerily While a boy listened alone :
Made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily
All by himself on a stone.
Poor bells ! I forgive you; your good days are over,
Andmine, they are yet to be;
No listening, no longing, shall aught, aught discover:
You leave the story to me.
The foxglove shoots out of the green matted
heather,
Preparing her hoods of snow;
She was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather:
O, children take long to grow.
I wish, and I wish, that the spring would go
faster,
Nor long summer bide so late ;
AndI could grow on like the foxglove and aster,
For some things are ill to wait.
I wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover,
While dear hands are laid on my head;
"The child is a woman, the book may close only,
For all the lessons are said."

THE BAREFOOT BOY
Iwait for my story-the birds cannot sing it,
Not one, as he sits on the tree ;
The bells cannot ring it, but long years, O, bring it !
Such as I wish it to be.

THE BAREFOOT BOY
By John Greenleaf Whittier
LESSINGS on thee, little man,
Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!
With thy upturned pantaloons,
Andthy merry whistled tunes ;
With thy red lip, redder still Kissed by strawberries on the hill;
With the sunshine on thy face,
Through thy torn brim's jaunty grace;
From myheart I give thee joy- Iwas once a barefoot boy!
Prince thou art-the grown-up man Only is republican.
Let the million-dollared ride!
Barefoot, trudging at his side,
Thouhast more than he can buy In the reach of ear and eyeOutward sunshine, inward joy :
Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!
O for boyhood's painless play,
Sleep that wakes in laughing day,
Health that mocks the doctor's rules,
Knowledge never learned of schools:

THE BAREFOOT BOY
Of the wild bee's morning chase,
Of the wild flower's time and place,
Flight of fowl and habitude
Of the tenants of the wood;
How the tortoise bears his shell,
How the woodchuck digs his cell,
And the ground-mole sinks his well;
How the robin feeds her young,
How the oriole's nest is hung;
Where the whitest lilies blow,
Where the freshest berries grow,
Where the groundnut trails its vine,
Where the wood-grape's clusters shine;
Of the black wasp's cunning way,
Mason of his walls of clay,
And the architectural plans Of gray hornet artisans !-
For, eschewing books and tasks,
Nature answers all he asks ;
Hand in hand with her he walks,
Face to face with her he talks,
Part and parcel of her joy- Blessings on the barefoot boy!
O for boyhood's time of June,
Crowding years in one brief moon,
When all things I heard or saw,
Me, their master, waited for.
I was rich in flowers and trees,
Humming-birds and honey-bees ;
For my sport the squirrel played,
Plied the snouted mole his spade;
For my taste the blackberry cone

THE BAREFOOT BOY
Purpled over hedge and stone ;
Laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night,
Whispering at the garden wall,
Talked with me from fall to fall ;
Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,
Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
Mine, on bending orchard trees,
Apples of Hesperides !
Still, as my horizon grew,
Larger grew my riches, too;
All the world I saw or knew
Seemed a complex Chinese toy,
Fashioned for abarefoot boy!
O for festal dainties spread,
Like my bowl of milk and bread- Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,
On the door-stone, gray and rude!
O'er me like a regal tent,
Cloudy ribbed, the sunset bent,
Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,
Looped in many a wind-swung fold;
While for music came the play
Of the pied frogs' orchestra;
And, to light the noisy choir,
Lit the fly his lamp of fire.
Iwas monarch: pomp and joy Waited on the barefoot boy!
Cheerily, then, my little man,
Live and laugh as boyhood can!
Though the flinty slopes be hard,

THANKSGIVING DAY
Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,
Every morn shall lead thee through Fresh baptisms of the dew;
Every evening from thy feet
Shall the cool wind kiss the heat :
All too soon these feet must hide
In the prison cells of pride,
Lose the freedom of the sod,
Like a colt's for work be shod,
Made to tread the mills of toil,
Up and down in ceaseless moil :
Happy if their track be found Never on forbidden ground ;
Happy if they sink not in Quick and treacherous sands of sin,
Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,
Ere it passes, barefoot boy !

THANKSGIVING DAY
By Lydia Maria Child
VER the river and through the wood,
To grandfather's house we go;
The horse knows the way
To carry the sleigh
Through the white and drifted snow,
Over the river and through the wood- Oh, how the wind does blow!
It stings the toes,
And bites the nose,
As over the ground we go.

THE SWAN'S NEST
:
Over the river and through the wood,
To have a first-rate play.
Hear the bells ring,
"Ting-a-ling-ding! "
Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day !
Over the river and through the wood Trot fast, mydapple-gray!
Spring over the ground,
Like a hunting-hound!
For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river and through the wood,
And straight through the barnyard gate.
Weseem to go Extremely slowIt is so hard to wait !
Over the river and through the woodNow grandmother's cap I spy !
Hurrah for the fun!
Is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!
THE ROMANCE OF THE SWAN'S
NEST
By Elizabeth Barrett Browning
ITTLE Ellie sits alone EMid the beeches of ameadow,
By a stream-side on the grass,
And the trees are showering down Doubles of their leaves in shadow,
On her shining hair and face.

THE SWAN'S NEST
She has thrown her bonnet by,
Andher feet she has been dipping In the shallow water's flow.
Now she holds them nakedly In her hands all sleek and dripping,
While she rocketh to and fro.
Little Ellie sits alone,
And the smile she softly uses Fills the silence like a speech,
While she thinks what shall be done
And the sweetest pleasure chooses
For her future within reach.
Little Ellie in her smile
Chooses *** "I will have a lover,
:
Riding on a steed of steeds !
He shall love me without guile,
And to him I will discover
The swan's nest among the reeds.
"And the steed shall be red-roan,
And the lover shall be noble,
With an eye that takes the breath.
And the lute he plays upon Shall strike ladies into trouble,
As his sword strikes men to death.
"And the steed it shall be shod
All ' in silver, housed in azure,
And the mane shall swim the wind;
And the boofs along the sod
Shall flash onward and keep measure,
Till the shepherds look behind.

THE SWAN'S NEST
"But my lover will not prize All the glory that he rides in,
Whenhe gazes in my face.
Hewill say, O Love, thine eyes Build the shrine my soul abides in,
And I kneel here for thy grace.'
"Then, ay then-he shall kneel low,
With the red-roan steed anear him,
Which shall seem to understandTill I answer, 'Rise and go !
For the world must love and fear him
Whom I gift with heart and hand.'
"Then he will arise so pale,
I shall feel my own lips tremble With a yes I must not say ;
Nathless maiden-brave, ' Farewell '
I will utter, and dissemble ;-
' Light to-morrow with to-day.'
"Then he'll ride among the hills
To the wide world past the river,
There to put away all wrong ;
To make straight distorted wills,
And to empty the broad quiver Which the wicked bear along.
" Three times shall a young foot-page Swim the stream and climb the mountain
And kneel down beside my feet ;-
'Lo, my master sends this gage,
Lady, for thy pity's counting !
What wilt thou exchange for it ? '

THE SWAN'S NEST
"And the first time, I will send
Awhite rosebud for aguerdon- Andthe second time, aglove ;
But the third time, Imay bend From my pride, and answer, 'Pardon,
If he comes to take my love.'
"Then the young foot-page will run- Then my lover will ride faster,
Till he kneeleth at my knee:
'I am a duke's eldest son!
Thousand serfs do call me master
But, O Love, I love but thee!
"He will kiss me on the mouth
Then, and lead me as a lover
Through the crowds that praise his deeds;
And, when soul-tied by one troth,
Unto him I will discover
That swan's nest among the reeds."
Little Ellie, with her smile
Not yet ended, rose up gayly,
Tied the bonnet, donned the shoe,
And went homeward, round amile,
Just to see, as she did daily,
What more eggs were with the two.
Pushing through the elm-tree copse,
Winding up the stream, light-hearted,
Where the osier pathway leads- Past the boughs she stoops-and stops.
Lo, the wild swan had deserted,
And a rat had gnawed the reeds.

THE VOICE OF SPRING
Ellie went home sad and slow.
If she found the lover ever,
With his red-roan steed of steeds,
Sooth I know not! but I know
She could never show him-never,
That swan's nest among the reeds !
I
THE VOICE OF SPRING
By Mary Howitt
AM coming, I am coming!
Hark! the little bee is humming;
See, the lark is soaring high In the blue and sunny sky;
And the gnats are on the wing,
Wheeling round in airy ring.
See the yellow catkins cover
All the slender willows over !
And on the banks of mossy green Star-like primroses are seen;
And, their clustering leaves below,
White and purple violets blow.
Hark! the new-born lambs are bleating,
Andthe cawing rooks are meeting In the elms a noisy crowd;
All the birds are singing loud ;
And the first white butterfly Inthe sunshine dances by.

GREEN THINGS GROWING
Look around thee, look around!
Flowers in all the fields abound:
Every running stream is bright ;
All the orchard trees are white;
And each small and waving shoot Promises sweet flowers and fruit.
Turn thine eyes to earth and heaven:
God for thee the spring has given,
Taught the birds their melodies,
Clothed the earth and cleared the skies
For thy pleasure or thy food;
Pour thy soul in gratitude.

GREEN THINGS GROWING
By Dinah Maria Mulock
H, the green things growing, the green things growing,
The faint sweet smell of the green things growing!
I should like to live, whether I smile or grieve,
Just to watch the happy life of my green things
growing.
Oh, the fluttering and the pattering of those green things growing!
How they talk each to each, when none of us are
knowing;
In the wonderful white of the weird moonlight
Or the dim dreamy dawn when the cocks are crowing.

DAFFODILS
I love, I love them so my green things growing!
And I think that they love me, without false
showing;
For by many a tender touch, they comfort me so
much,
With the soft mute comfort of green things growing.
A BOY'S PRAYER
By H. C. Beeching
MODwho created me G☑ Nimble and light of limb,
In three elements free,
To run, to ride, to swim
Not when the sense is dim,
But now from the heart of joy,
I would remember Him:
Take the thanks of aboy.

DAFFODILS
By William Wordsworth
WANDERED lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales andhills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils,
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering anddancing in the breeze.

DAFFODIL
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
Apoet could not but be gay In such a jocund company.
Igazed, and gazed, but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought.
For oft, when on my couch I lie Invacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude;
And thenmyheart with pleasure fills,
Anddances with the daffodils.
DAFFODIL
By Katherine Tynan Hinkson

HO passes downthe wintry street?
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Asudden flame of gold and sweet,
With sword of emerald girt to meet.
Andgolden gay from head to feet.

JULY
How are you here this wintryday?
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Your radiant fellows yet delay.
No wind flower dances scarlet gay,
Nor crocus flame lights up the way.
What land of cloth o' gold andgreen,
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Cloth o' gold with the green between.
Was that you left but yestere'en,
To light a gloomy world and mean?
King Trumpeter to Flora's queen,
Hey, ho, daffodil!
Blow, and the goldenjousts begin.

JULY
By Susan Hartley Swett
WHEN the scarlet cardinal tells
Her dream to the dragon fly,
Andthe lazy breeze makes a nest in the trees
And murmurs alullaby,
It is July.
When the tangled cobweb pulls The cornflower's cap awry,
And the lilies tall lean over the wall
To bow to the butterfly,
It is July.

THE FRINGED GENTIAN
i
When the heat like a mist veil floats,
And poppies flame in the rye,
And the silver note in the streamlet's throat
Has softened almost to a sigh,
It is July.
When the hours are so still that time
Forgets them, and lets them lie 'Neath petals pink till the night stars wink At the sunset in the sky,
It is July.
When each finger-post by the way
Says that Slumbertown is nigh;
When the grass is tall, and the roses fall,
Andnobody wonders why,
It is July.

TO THE FRINGED GENTIAN
T
By William Cullen Bryant
HOU blossom, bright with autumn dew,
Andcolored with the heaven's own blue,
That openest when the quiet light
Succeeds the keen and frosty night,
Thou comest not when violets lean
O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
Or columbines, in purple dressed,
Nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest.

SUMMER DAYS
Thou waitest late, and com'st alone,
When woods are bare and birds are flown,
Andfrosts and shortening days portend
The aged Year is near his end.
Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
Look through its fringes to the sky,
Blue-blue-as if that sky let fall
Aflower from its cerulean wall.
I would that thus, when I shall see
The hour of death draw near to me,
Hope, blossoming within my heart,
May look to heaven as I depart.
SUMMER DAYS
Anonymous
INTER is cold-hearted;
Autumn is a weathercock;
Blown every way:
Summer days for me
When every leaf is on its tree,
When Robin's not a beggar,
And Jenny Wren's a bride,
And larks hang, singing, singing, singing,
Over the wheat-fields wide,
And anchored lilies ride,
And the pendulum spider Swings from side to side.

SPARE THAT TREE
And blue-black beetles transact business,
And gnats fly in ahost And furry caterpillars hasten
That no time be lost,
Andmoths grow fat and thrive,
And lady birds arrive.
Before green apples blush,
Before green nuts embrown,
Why, one day in the country
Is worth a month in townIs worth a day and ayear
Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion That days drone elsewhere.
WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE !
By George Pope Morris
WOODMAN,aspare singlethat boughtree!
In youth it sheltered me,
And I'll protect it now.
'Twas my forefather's hand That placed it near his cot;
There, woodman, let it stand,
Thy ax shall harm it not.
That old familiar tree,
Whose glory and renown
Are spread o'er land and sea- And wouldst thou hew it down?
:

DAISY'S SONG
Woodman, forbear thy stroke !
Cut not its earth-bound ties ;
Oh, spare that aged oak Now towering to the skies !
Whenbut an idle boy,
I sought its grateful shade ;
In all their gushing joy Here, too, my sisters played.
My mother kissed me here ;
My father pressed my hand- Forgive this foolish tear,
But let that old oak stand.
My heart-strings round thee cling,
Close as thy bark, old friend !
Here shall the wild-bird sing,
And still thy branches bend.
Old tree! the storm still brave !
And, woodman, leave the spot ;
While I've a hand to save,
Thy ax shall harm it not.

DAISY'S SONG
By John Keats
HE sun with his great eye,
Sees not so much as I;
And the moon, all silver-proud,
Might as well be in a cloud.

THE FROST
And oh, the spring-the spring!
I lead the life of a king!
Couch'd in the teeming grass,
I spy each pretty lass.
I look where no one dares,
And I stare where no one stares,
And when the night is nigh,
Lambs bleat my lullaby.
T
THE FROST
By Hannah Flagg Gould
HE Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,
Andwhispered, "Now I shall be out of sight ;
So through the valley and over the height,
In silence I'll take my way:
I will not go on with that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,
But I'll be as busy as they."
Then he flew to the mountain and powdered its
crest;
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed In diamond beads-and over the breast
Of the quivering lake he spread
Acoat of mail, that it need not fear
The downward point of many a spear
That hung on its margin far andnear,
Where a rock could rear its head.

ALMOND BLOSSOM
Hewent to the windows of those who slept,
And over each pane, like a fairy, crept ;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he slept,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things-there were flowers and
trees;
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees ;
There were cities with temples and towers, and these
All pictured in silver sheen!
But he did one thing that was hardly fair;
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there
That all had forgotten for him to prepare-
"Nowjust to set them a-thinking,
I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,
"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,
And the glass of water they've left for me Shall ' tchich! to tell them I'm drinking."
ALMOND BLOSSOM
By Edwin Arnold
BLOSSOM of the LOSSOM of the almond-trees,
April's gift to April's bees,
Birthday ornament of spring,
Flora's fairest daughterling;-
Coming when no flowerets dare
Trust the cruel outer air,
When the royal king-cup bold
Dares not donhis coat of gold,

A SONG OF CLOVER
And the sturdy blackthorn spray
Keeps his silver for the May;-
Coming when no flowerets would,
Save thy lowly sisterhood,
Early violets, blue and white,
Dying for their love of light.
Almond blossom, sent to teach us
That the spring days soon will reach us,
Lest, with longing over-tried,
We die as the violets diedBlossom, clouding all the tree With thy crimson broidery,
Long before a leaf of green On the bravest bough is seenAh! when winter winds are swinging
All thy red bells into ringing,
With a bee in every bell,
Almond bloom, we greet thee well.

A SONG OF CLOVER
By Saxe Holm
WONDER what the Clover thinks,
Intimate friend of Bob-o' -links,
Lover of Daisies slim and white,
Waltzer with Buttercups at night ;
Keeper of Inn for travelling Bees,
Serving to them wine-dregs and lees,
Left by the Royal Humming Birds,
Who sip and pay with fine-spun words;

A STORM
I
Fellow with all the lowliest,
Peer of the gayest and the best;
Comrade of winds, beloved of sun,
Kissed by the Dew-drops one by one;
Prophet of Good-luck mystery By sign of four which few may see;
Symbol of Nature's magic zone;
One out of three, and three in one;
Emblem of comfort in the speech
Which poor men's babies early reach;
Sweet by the roadsides, sweet by rills,
Sweet in the meadows, sweet on hills,
Sweet in its white, sweet in its redOh, half its sweetness cannot be said;-
Sweet in its every living breath.
Sweetest, perhaps, at last indeath!
Oh, whoknows what the Clover thinks ?
No one! unless the Bob-o' -links !
A STORM IN THE DISTANCE
By Paul H. Hayne
SEE the cloud-born squadrons of the gale,
Their lines of rain like glittering spears
deprest,
While all the affrighted land grows darkly pale
In flashing charge on earth's half-shielded breast.
Sounds like the rush of trampling columns float
From that fierce conflict ; volleyed thunders peal,
Blent with the maddened wind's wild bugle-note;
The lightnings flash, the solid woodlands reel !

SEVEN TIMES FOUR
Ha! many a foliaged guardian of the height,
Majestic pine or chestnut, riven and bare,
Falls in the rage of that aerial flight,
Led by the Prince of all the Powers of air!
Vast boughs like shattered banners hurtling fly
Down the thick tumult; while, like emerald snow,
Millions of orphaned leaves make wild the sky,
Or drift in shuddering helplessness below.
Still, still, the levelled lances of the rain
At earth's half-shielded breast take glittering
aim;
All space is rife with fury, racked with pain,
Earth bathed in vapor, and heaven rent by flame !
At last the cloud battalions through long rifts Of luminous mists retire:-the strife is done,
And earth once more her wounded beauty lifts,
To meet the healing kisses of the sun.
H
SEVEN TIMES FOUR
By Jean Ingelow
EIGH-HO! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tall!
Whenthe wind wakes, how they rock in the grasses,
Anddance with the cuckoo-buds slender and small!
Here's two bonny boys, and here's mother's own
lasses,
Eager to gather them all.

TO A SKYLARK
Heigh-ho ! Daisies and buttercups !
Mother shall thread them a daisy chain;
Sing them a song of the pretty hedge-sparrow,
That loved her brown little ones, loved them full
fair;
Sing, "Heart thou art wide, though the house be but narrow,"
Sing once, and sing it again.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Sweet wagging cowslips, they bend and they bow;
Aship sails afar over warm ocean waters,
Andhaply one musing doth stand at her prow.
Obonny brown sons, and O sweet little daughters,
Maybe he thinks on you now.
Heigh-ho! Daisies and buttercups,
Fair yellow daffodils stately and tallAsunshiny world full of laughter and leisure,
And fresh hearts unconscious of sorrow and thrall !
Send down on their pleasure smiles passing its
measure,
God that is over us all !
TO A SKYLARK
By Percy Bysshe Shelley
HAILBirdto theenever , blithe spirit !
That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

TO A SKYLARK
Higher still and higher From the earth thou springest:
Like a cloud of fire,
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,
Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight,
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delightKeen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere
Whose intense lamp narrows In the white dawn clear,
Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.
All the earth and air
With they voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow'd.

TO A SKYLARK
What thou art we know not ;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see As from thy presence showers arain of melody:-
Like a poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like ahigh-born maiden
In a palace tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love which overflows her
bower:
Like a glow-worm golden In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aërial hue
Among the flowers and grass which screen it from
the view:
Like a rose embowered
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives Makes faint with too much sweet these heavywingèd thieves.

TO A SKYLARK
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was,
Joyous and clear and fresh-thy music doth
surpass.
Teach us, sprite or bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine :
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus hymeneal
Or triumphal chaunt,
Match'd with thine, would be all
But an empty vauntA thing wherein we feel there is some hidden
want.
What objects are the fountains Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of
pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.

TO A SKYLARK
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet, if we could scorn,
Hate and pride, and fear;
If we were things born Not to shed a tear,
Iknow not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Ofdelightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know;
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow The world should listen then as I am listening now

THE BROOK
H
SWIMMING
By Lord Byron
OWmany atime have I
Cloven with arm still lustier, breast more
daring,
The wave all roughen'd; with a swimmer's stroke
Flinging the billows back from my drench'd hair,
And laughing from my lip the audacious brine,
Which kiss'd it like a wine-cup, rising o'er
The waves as they arose, and prouder still The loftier they uplifted me; and oft,
In wantonness of spirit, plunging down Into the green and glossy gulfs, and making My way to shells and sea-weed, all unseen By those above, till they wax'd fearful; then
Returning with my grasp full of such tokens
As show'd that I had search'd the deep: exulting,
With a far dashing stroke, and drawing deep The long-suspended breath, again I spurn'd The foam which broke around me, and pursued My track like a sea-bird-I was aboy then.

THE BROOK
By Alfred Tennyson
COME from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally,
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.

THE BROOK

By thirty hills
I hurry down
,
Or slip between the ridges
,
By twenty thorps,
a little town,
And half
a hundred bridges
.
Till last by Philip's farm
I flow To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
I chatter over stony ways
,
In little sharps and trebles,
I bubble into eddying bays
,
I babble on the pebbles
.
With many
a curve my banks
I fret
By many
a field and fallow,
Andmany
a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow
.
I chatter, chatter
, as
I flow
To join the brimming river
,
For men may come and men may go,
But
I go on forever
.
Iwind about
, and in and out,
With here
a blossom sailing
,
Andhere and there
a lusty trout,
Andhere and there
agrayling
,
And here and there
a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak
Above the golden gravel,

THE BUGLE SONG
And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
I slide by hazel covers ;
I move the sweet forget-me-nots
That grow for happy lovers.
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
Among my skimming swallows ;
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy shallows.
I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesses ;
Ilinger by my shingly bars ;
I loiter round my cresses ;
'And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
THE BUGLE SONG
By Alfred Tennyson
THEsplendor falls HE splendor falls on castle walls
And snowy summits old in story:
The long light shakes across the lakes
And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
Blow, bugle ; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

THE BRAVE OLD OAK
O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
And thinner, clearer, farther going!
O sweet and far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying :
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
O love, they die in yon rich sky,
They faint on hill or field or river:
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow forever and forever.
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

THE BRAVE OLD OAK
By H. F. Chorley
SONG to the oak, the brave old oak,
Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;
Here's health and renown to his broad green crown,
Andhis fifty arms so strong.
There's fear in his frown when the sun goes down,
And the fire in the west fades out;
And he showeth his might on a wild midnight,
When the storm through his branches shout.
Then here's to the oak, the brave old oak,
Who stands in his pride alone ;
And still flourish he, a hale green tree,
When a hundred years are gone!

DAYBREAK
In the days of old, when the spring with cold
Had brightened his branches gray,
Through the grass at his feet crept maidens sweet,
To gather the dew of May.
And on that day to the rebeck gay They frolicked with lovesome swains ;
They are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid,
But the tree it still remains.
Then here's, &c.
He saw the rare times when the Christmas chimes
Was amerry sound to hear,
When the squire's wide hall and the cottage small Were filled with good English cheer.
Now gold hath the sway we all obey,
And a ruthless king is he;
But he never shall send our ancient friend
To be tossed on the stormy sea.
Then here's, &c.
A
DAYBREAK
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
WIND came up out of the sea,
And said, "O mists, make room for me!"
It hailed the ships, and cried, "Sail on,
Ye mariners, the night is gone."
Andhurried landward far away,
Crying, "Awake! it is the day."

THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
It said unto the forest, "Shout!
Hang all your leafy banners out! "
It touched the wood-bird's folded wing,
And said, "O bird, awake and sing!"
And o'er the farms, "O chanticleer,
Your clarion blow; the day is near!"
It whispered to the fields of corn,
"Bow down, and hail the coming morn! "
It shouted through the belfry-tower,
"Awake, Obell! proclaim the hour."
It crossed the churchyard with a sigh,
Andsaid, "Not yet! in quiet lie."
THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
By Edward Fitzgerald
'T
IS adull sight To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing :
Sighing, oh ! sighing :
When such a time cometh,
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire :
Oh, pile a bright fire!

THE MEADOWS IN SPRING
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings- Oh, drearily sings !
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast :
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry- Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth- How ' twas gladsome, but often Foolish, forsooth :
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or to get merry We sing some old rhyme,
That made the wood ring again In summer timeSweet summer time!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrilySo merrily !

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
And ere to bed
Gowe, go we,
Down on the ashes
Wekneel on the knee,
Praying together !
Thus, then, live I,
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By heaven! the bold sun Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green,
Ijump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!
HIAWATHA'S SAILING
By Henry W. Longfellow
"GIVEme IVE me of your bark, OBirchtree!
☑ Of your yellow bark, OBirch tree !
Growing by the rushing river,
Tall and stately in the valley!
I a light canoe will build me,
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
That shall float upon the river,
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily !
"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch tree!
Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,
For the summer-time is coming,
And the sun is warm in heaven,
And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
In the solitary forest,
When the birds were singing gaily,
In the moon of leaves were singing,
And the Sun, from sleep awaking,
Started up and said, "Behold me!
Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
And the tree with all its branches
Rustled in the breeze of morning,
Saying, with a sigh of patience,
"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha! "
With his knife the tree he girdled;
Just beneath its lowest branches,
Just above the roots, he cut it,
Till the sap came oozing outward;
Down the trunk, from top to bottom,
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,
With awooden wedge he raised it,
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!
Of your strong and pliant branches,
My canoe to make more steady,
Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
Through the summit of the cedar
Went a sound, acry of horror,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
Went a murmur of resistance ;
But it whispered, bending downward,
"Take my boughs, O Hiawatha! "
Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,
Shaped them straightway to a framework,
Like two bows he formed and shaped them,
Like two bended bows together.
"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!
Of your fibrous roots, O Larch tree!
My canoe to bind together.
So to bind the ends together That the water may not enter,
That the river may not wet me! "
And the larch, with all its fibers,
Shivered in the air of morning,
Touched his forehead with its tassels,
Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,
"Take them all, O Hiawatha ! "
From the earth he tore the fibers,
Tore the tough roots of the larch tree,
Closely sewed the bark together,
Bound it closely to the framework.
"Give me of your balm, O Fir tree !
Of your balsam and your resin,
So to close the seams together
That the water may not enter,
That the river may not wet me!"
And the fir tree, tall and somber,
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,
Rattled like a shore with pebbles,
Answered wailing, answered weeping,
"Take my balm, O Hiawatha! "
Andhe took the tears of balsam,

HIAWATHA'S SAILING
Took the resin of the fir tree,
Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,
Made each crevice safe from water.
"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!
I will make a necklace of them,
Make a girdle for my beauty,
And two stars to deck her bosom!"
From a hollow tree the hedgehog
With his sleepy eyes looked at him,
Shot his shining quills, like arrows,
Saying, with a drowsy murmur,
Through the tangle of his whiskers,
"Take my quills, O Hiawatha! "
From the ground the quills he gathered,
All the little shining arrows,
Stained them red and blue and yellow,
With the juice of roots and berries ;
Into his canoe he wrought them,
Round its waist a shining girdle,
Round its bows agleaming necklace,
On its breast two stars resplendent.
Thus the birch canoe was builded
In the valley, by the river,
In the bosom of the forest ;
And the forest's life was in it,
All its mystery and its magic,
All the lightness of the birch tree,
All the toughness of the cedar,
All the larch's supple sinew;
And it floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily.

PROCESSION OF THE FLOWERS
F
By Sydney Dobell
IRST came the primrose,
On the bank high,
Like a maiden looking forth From the window of a tower
When the battle rolls below,
So looked she,
And saw the storms go by.
Then came the wind-flower
In the valley left behind,
As awounded maiden pale With purple streaks of woe
When the battle has roll'd by Wanders to and fro,
So tottered she,
Dishevell'd in the wind.
Then came the daisies,
On the first of May,
Like a bannered show's advance
While the crowd runs by the way,
With ten thousand flowers about them
They came trooping through the fields.
As a happy people come,
So came they ;
As a happy people come When the war has rolled away,
With dance and tabor, pipe and drum,
And all make holiday.

THE TIGER
Then came the cowslip Like a dancer in the fair,
She spread her little mat of green,
And on it danced she.
With a fillet bound about her brow,
Afillet round her happy brow,
Agolden fillet round her brow,
And rubies in her hair.

THE TIGER
By William Blake
IGER, tiger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes ?
Onwhat wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain ?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

A SEA SONG
When the stars threw down their spears,
And water'd heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see ?
Did He who made the lamb make thee ?
Tiger, tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?

A SEA SONG
By Allan Cunningham
WET sheet and a flowing sea,
Awind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail Andbends the gallant mast ;
And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
While, like the eagle free,
Away the good ship flies, and leaves
Old England on the lee.
"Ofor a soft and gentle wind! "
I heard a fair one cry ;
But give to me the snoring breeze And white waves heaving high ;
And white waves heaving high, my lads,
The good ship tight and free- The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.

MERRY SUMMER MONTHS
There's tempest in yon hornèd moon And lightning in yon cloud;
But hark the music, mariners !
The wind is piping loud;
The wind is piping loud, my boys,
The lightning flashes free,
While the hollow oak our palace is,
Our heritage the sea.

THEY COME: THE MERRY SUMMER
MONTHS
T
By William Motherwell
HEY come! the merry summer months of beauty, song, and flowers ;
They come! the gladsome months that bring thick leafiness to bowers.
Up, up, myheart! and walk abroad; fling cark and care aside;

MERRY SUMMER MONTHS
Seek silent hills, or rest thyself where peaceful waters glide ;
Or, underneath the shadow vast of patriarchal
tree,
Scan through its leaves the cloudless sky in rapt tranquillity.
The grass is soft, its velvet touch is grateful to the hand;
And, like the kiss of maiden love, the breeze is
sweet and bland;
The daisy and the buttercup are nodding cour- teously;
It stirs their blood with kindest love, to bless and
welcome thee ;
And mark how with thine own thin locks-they
now are silvery grayThat blissful breeze is wantoning, and whispering,
"Be gay!"
There is no cloud that sails along the ocean of yon
sky
melody;
But hath its own winged mariners to give it
Thou seest their glittering fans outspread, all
gleaming like red gold;
And hark! with shrill pipe musical, their merry course they hold.
Godbless them all, those little ones, who, far above
this earth,
Can make a scoff of its mean joys, and vent a
nobler mirth.

MERRY SUMMER MONTHS
But soft! mine ear upcaught a sound-from yonder
wood it came!
The spirit of the dim green glade did breathe his own glad name;-
Yes, it is he! the hermit bird, that, apart from all
۱ his kind,
Slow spells his beads monotonous to the soft western wind;
void of art ;
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! he sings again-his notes are
But simplest strains do soonest sound the deep
founts of the heart.
Good Lord! it is agracious boon for thought-crazed wight like me,
To smell again these summer flowers beneath this
summer tree!
To suck once more in every breath their little souls
And feed my fancy with fond dreams of youth's away,
bright summer day,
When, rushing forth like untamed colt, the reck- less, truant boy
mighty heart of joy!
Wandered through greenwoods all day long, a
I'm sadder now-I have had cause; but O, I'm
proud to think That each pure joy-fount, loved of yore, I yet delight to drink ; -
Leaf, blossom, blade, hill, valley, stream, the calm,
unclouded sky,

LITTLE DANDELION
Still mingle music with mydreams, as in the days gone by.
When summer's loveliness and light fall round me dark and cold,
I'll bear indeed life's heaviest curse-a heart that
hath waxed old!

AYlittle Dandelion
Lights up the meads,
Swings on her slender foot,
Telleth her beads,
Lists to the robin's note
Poured from above :
Wise little Dandelion
Asks not for love.
Cold lie the daisy banks
Clothed but in green,
Where, in the days agone,
Bright hues were seen.
Wild pinks are slumbering ;
Violets delay :
True little Dandelion
Greeteth the May.
Brave little Dandelion !
Fast falls the snow,
Bending the daffodil's
Haughty head low.

THE DAY IS DONE
Under that fleecy tent,
Careless of cold,
Blithe little Dandelion
Counteth her gold.
Meek little Dandelion
Groweth more fair,
Till dies the amber dew
Out from her hair.
High rides the thirsty sun,
Fiercely and high ;
Faint little Dandelion
Closeth her eye.
Pale little Dandelion,
In her white shroud,
Heareth the angel-breeze Call from the cloud!
Tiny plumes fluttering Make no delay!
Little winged Dandelion
Soareth away.
THE DAY IS DONE
By Henry W. Longfellow
HE day is done, and the darkness T Falls from the wings of Night,
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.

THE DAY IS DONE
I see the lights of the village Gleam through the rain and the mist,
Anda feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
That my soul cannot resist :
A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.
Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of day.
Not from the grand old masters,
Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of Time.
For, like strains of martial music,
Their mighty thoughts suggest Life's endless toil and endeavor ;
And to-night I long for rest.
Read from some humbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart,
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or tears from the eyelids start ;
Who, through long days of labor,
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.

SAILOR'S SONG
Such songs have power to quiet The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
That follows after prayer.
Then read from the treasured volume
The poem of thy choice,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice.
And the night shall be filled with music,
And the cares that infest the day,
Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,
And as silently steal away.
SAILOR'S SONG
By Thomas Lowell Beddoes
O sea, to sea! The calm is o'er;
The wanton water leaps in sport,
And rattles down the pebbly shore ;
The dolphin wheels, the sea cows snort,
Andunseen mermaids' pearly song
Comes bubbling up, the weeds among.
Fling broad the sail, dip deep the oar:
To sea, to sea! the calm is o'er.
To sea, to sea! our wide-winged bark Shall billowy cleave its sunny way,
And with its shadow, fleet and dark,
Break the caved Triton's azure day,

THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS

Like mighty eagle soaring light
O'er antelopes on Alpine height.
The anchor heaves, the ship swings free,
The sails swell full. To sea, to sea!
THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
HIS
By Oliver Wendell Holmes
is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
Sails the unshadowed mainThe venturous bark that flings Onthe sweet summer wind its purpled wings
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaminghair.
Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wontto dwell As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealedIts irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!
Year after year beheld the silent toil That spread his lustrous coil ;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year's dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old
no more.

HOME, SWEET HOME
Thanks for the heavenly message brought by
thee,
Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap, forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!
While on mine ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings :-
Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll !
Leave thy low-vaulted past !
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with adome more vast
Till thou at length are free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!
HOME, SWEET HOME
By John Howard Payne
ID pleasures and palaces though we may MIDroam,

Acharm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet, sweet home!
There's no place like home!

YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain!
Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!
The birds singing gayly that came at my call :-
Oh, give me sweet peace of mind, dearer than all !
Home, home, sweet, sweet home !
There's no place like home!
YE MARINERS OF ENGLAND

By Thomas Campbell
E mariners of England,
That guard our native seas ;
Whose flag has braved, athousand years,
The battle and the breeze!
Your glorious standard launch again
To match another foe!
And sweep through the deep,
While the stormy winds do blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.
The spirits of your fathers Shall start from every wave ;
For the deck it was their field of fame,
And Ocean was their grave.
Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,
Your manly hearts shall glow,
As ye sweep through the deep,
While the stormy winds do blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy winds do blow.

BOYHOOD
Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep;
Her march is o'er the mountain-waves,
Her home is on the deep.
With thunders from her native oak,
She quells the floods belowAs they roar on the shore,
When the stormy winds do blow;
When the battle rages loud and long And the stormy winds do blow.
The meteor flag of England Shall yet terrific burn;
Till danger's troubled night depart,
And the star of peace return.
Then, then, ye ocean warriors !
Oursong and feast shall flow
To the fame of your name,
When the storm has ceased to blow;
When the fiery fight is heard no more And the storm has ceased to blow.

The minutes parting one by one like rays,

But O, what charm or magic numbers
Can give me back the gentle slumbers

Their heads never raising ;
There are forty feeding like one!

The snow hath retreated,
And now doth fare ill

Small clouds are sailing,
Blue sky prevailing ;
The rain is over and gone!

Along life's merry way?
Acomrade blithe and full of glee,
Who dares to laugh out loud and free,
And let his frolic fancy play,
Like ahappy child, through the flowers gay
That fill the field and fringe the way
Where he walks a mile with me.
And who will walk a mile with me
Along life's weary way?
Afriend whose heart has eyes to see
The stars shine out o'er the darkening lea,
Andthe quiet rest at the end o' the dayA friend who knows and dares to say,
The brave, sweet words that cheer the way
Where he walks a mile with me.

It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For who has sight so keen and strong That it can follow the flight of song?

I found the arrow, still unbroke;
Andthe song, frombeginning to end,
Ifoundagain in the heart of afriend.

With the blue above and the blue below,
Andsilence wheresoe'er I go.
If a storm should come and awake the deep,
What matter? I shall ride and sleep.
I love, O, how I love to ride
On the fierce, foaming, bursting tide,
Where every madwave drowns the moon,
And whistles aloft its tempest tune
And tells how goeth the world below,
Andwhy the southwest wind doth blow!

The whale it whistled, the porpoise rolled,
Andthe dolphins bared their backs of gold;
And never was heard such an outcry wild,
As welcomed to life the ocean child.
Ihave lived since then, in calm and strife,

TRAVELLER through a dusty road strewed
acorns on the lea ;
And one took root and sprouted up, and grew
into a tree.
Love sought its shade, at evening time, to breathe its early vows ;
And age was pleased, in heats of noon, to bask beneath its boughs ;
The dormouse loved its dangling twigs, the birds sweet music bore;
It stood a glory in its place, a blessing evermore.

SMALL BEGININNGS
Alittle spring had lost its way amid the grass and fern,
Apassing stranger scooped a well, where weary men might turn;
He walled it in, and hung with care a ladle at the
brink;
He thought not of the deed he did, but judged that toil might drink.
He passed again, and lo! the well, by summers never dried,
Had cooled ten thousand parching tongues, and saved a life beside.
Adreamer dropped a random thought; 'twas old,
and yet 'twas new;
Ásimple fancy of the brain, but strong in being
true.
It shone upon a genial mind, and lo! its light became
Alamp of life, abeacon ray, amonitory flame.
The thought was small; its issue great; a watch-fire on the hill ;
It sheds its radiance far adown, and cheers the
valley still!
Anameless man, amid acrowd that thronged the daily mart,
Let fall a word of Hope and Love, unstudied from the heart;
A whisper on the tumult thrown-a transitory
breathIt raised a brother from the dust; it saved a soul
from death.

Who, flung on the rich breast of luxury, eat of the
rankness that kills.
Ah! little they know of the blessedness toil-purchased slumber enjoys Who, stretched on the hard rack of indolence, taste
of the sleep that destroys ;
Nothing to hope for, or labor for; nothing to sigh
for, or gain;
Nothing to light in its vividness, lightning-like,
bosom and brain;
Nothing to break life's monotony, rippling it o'er with its breath :
Nothing but dulness and lethargy, weariness,
sorrow, and death!

The village smithy stands ;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands ;
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands.
His hair is crisp, and black, and long,
His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat,
He earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.

Weekin, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is low.

They love to see the flaming forge,
And hear the bellows roar,
Andcatch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff from a threshing floor.

And sits among his boys ;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
Hehears his daughter's voice,
Singing in the village choir,
And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother's voice,
Singing in Paradise !
He needs must think of her once more,
How in the grave she lies ;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes Atear out of his eyes.
Toiling-rejoicing-sorrowing,
Onward through life he goes ;
Each morning sees some task begin,
Each evening sees it close ;
Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night's repose.

That hangs his head, and a' that?
The coward slave, we pass him by,
Wedare be poor for a' that ;
For a' that, and a' that,
Our toils obscure, and a' that;
The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
The man's the gowd for a' that!
What though onhamely fare we dine,
Wearhoddin-gray,' and a' that;
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,
Aman's a man for a' that!
For a' that, and a' that,
Their tinsel show, and a' that;
Thehonest man, though e'er sae poor,
Is king o' men for a' that !
Ye see yon birkie ca'd alord,
Wha struts, and stares, and a' that;
Though hundreds worship at his word,
He's but a coof for a' that;
Coarse woolen clothes. * Impudent fellow. Fool, blockhead.

PROCRASTINATION
For a' that, and a' that,
His riband, star, and a' that,
Theman of independent mind,
He looks and laughs at a' that.
Aprince can make a belted knight,
Amarquis, duke, and a' that ;
But an honest man's aboon his might,
Guid faith he maunna fa' that !
For a' that, and a' that,
Their dignities, and a' that,
The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth,
Are higher rank than a' that.
Then let us pray that come it mayAs come it will for a' thatThat sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,

For a' that, and a' that,

PROCRASTINATION
By Robert Southwell
HUN delays, they breed remorse;
Take thy time while time is lent thee;
Creeping snails have weakest force;
Fly thy fault, lest thou repent thee;
Good is best when soonest wrought,
Lingering labors come to naught.

CARDINAL WOLSEY'S SPEECH
Hoist up sail while gale doth last ;
Tide and wind wait no man's pleasure;
Seek not time when time is past;
Sober speed is wisdom's leisure ;
Afterwits are dearly bought,
Let thy forewit guide thy thought.
CARDINAL WOLSEY SPEECH TO
CROMWELL
C
By William Shakespeare
ROMWELL, Idid not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Let's dry our eyes : and thus far hear me, Cromwell ;
And-when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of-say, I taught thee,
Say, Wolsey-that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honorFound thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
Asure and safe one, though thy master missed it.
Mark but my fall, and that that ruined me.
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition :
By that sin fell the angels ; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by't?
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate
thee:
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:

WOLSEY'S FALL
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O
Cromwell!
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the king;
And-pr'ythee, lead me in:
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny; 'tis the king's : my robe,
And my integrity to heaven, is all Idare now call mine own. Ο Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies !
-From "Henry VIII."
WOLSEY'S FALL
By William Shakespeare
MAREWELL, along farewell, to all mygreat- Fness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost ;
And-whenhe thinks, good easy man, full surely His greatness is a ripening-nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.

SEVEN AGES OF MAN
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye :
I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors !
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have :
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.
-From "Henry VIII."
SEVEN AGES OF MAN
By William Shakespeare
ALL the world's a stage,
Andall the men and women merely players :
They have their exits and their entrances ;
And one maninhis time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,
Andshining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation Evenin the cannon's mouth. Andthen the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
Andsohe plays his part: the sixth age shifts

POLONIUS'S ADVICE
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side ;
His youthful hose, well saved, aworld too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivionSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
-From"As You Like It."
JOG ON
By William Shakespeare
JOGon OG on, jog on, the footpath way,
Andmerrily hent the stile-a ;
Amerryheart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile- a.

POLONIUS'S ADVICE
By William Shakespeare
IVE every man thy ear, but few thy voice :
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,

OVER HILL, OVER DALE
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all : to thine own self be true ;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
-From "Hamlet."

REPUTATION
By William Shakespeare
MOOD name in man or woman, dear my lord,
☑ Is the immediate jewel of their souls :
Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something,
nothing;
'Twasmine, 'tishis, and has been slave to thousands ;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
-From " Othello."
OVER HILL, OVER DALE
By William Shakespeare
VER hill, over dale,
through brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green:
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;

INGRATITUDE
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favors,
In those freckles live their savors :
Imust go seek some dew-drops here,
Andhang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
-From "A Midsummer-Night's Dream."

KNOW
blows;
I KNOW A BANK
By William Shakespeare
a bank where the wild thyme
Where oxlips, and the nodding violet grows ;
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine :
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight ;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
-From "A Midsummer- Night's Dream. "

INGRATITUDE
By William Shakespeare
LOW, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou are not so unkind
As man's ingratitude ;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou are not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.

MERCY
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot ;
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remember'd not.
WHERE THE BEE SUCKS
By William Shakespeare
HERE the bee sucks, there suck I: WHa cowslip's bell I lie ;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly After summer, merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now,
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
-From " The Tempest."
T
MERCY
By William Shakespeare
HE quality of mercy is not strained- It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Uponthe place beneath: it is twice blessedIt blesseth him that gives, and him that takes :
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The thronéd monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Werein doth sit the dread and fear of kings :

THE PEDLER'S PACK
But mercy is above this sceptred sway- It is enthronéd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice.
T
-From " The Merchant of Venice."
PERFECTION
By William Shakespeare
Ogild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
-From"King John."

AWN as white as driven snow ;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses ;
Masks for faces and for noses ;

Perfume for a lady's chamber :
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears ;
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,

By William Shakespeare
Enter TITANIA, with her train
TITANIA.
Come, now a roundel, and afairy
Then, for the third part of aminute, hence;-
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
Some, war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats; and some, keep back The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots, and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep ;
Then to your offices, and let me rest.
SONG
1 FAIRY. You spotted snakes, with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Nerets, and blind-worms, do no wrong;
Come not near our fairy queen.

Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.

Beetles black, approach not near;

OPPORTUNITY
By William Shakespeare
HERE is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to
fortune ;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows, and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
-From "Julius Cæsar."
HOTSPUR'S DESCRIPTION OF A FOP
OUT I
B
By William Shakespeare
remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin, new reap'd,
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
He was perfumed like amilliner ;
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose, and took 't away again;-
Who, therewith angry, when it next came there,
Took it in snuff :--and still he smiled and talk'd;

BUTTERCUP
Andas the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms Hequestioned me; amongst the rest, demanded My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting, with my wounds being cold,
To be so pester'd with apopinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience,
Answer'd neglectingly, I know not whatHe should, or he should not; for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,
Of guns, and drums, and wounds-God save the mark!-
Andtelling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.

BUTTERCUP
By Jean Ingelow
O the buttercups ! that field
O' the cloth of gold, where pennons swam,
Where France set up his lilied shield,
His oriflamb,

TO GENERAL CROMWELL
And Henry's lion-standard rolled ;
What was it to their matchless sheen,
Their million million drops of gold Among the green!
KNOWLEDGE
By William Cowper
NOWLEDGE and wisdom, far from being KNO one,
Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells
In heads replete with thoughts of other men,
Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.
TO THE LORD GENERAL CROMWELL
C
By John Milton
ROMWELL, our chief of men, who through a
cloud
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plowed,
And on the neck of crowned fortune proud Hast reared God's trophies, and his work pur sued,
While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued
And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud,
And Worcester's laureate wreath. Yet much remains

ON HIS BLINDNESS
To conquer still; peace hath her victories
No less renowned than war : new foes arise
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains :
Help us to save free conscience from the paw
Ofhireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw.
THE RAINBOW
By William Wordsworth
Yheart leaps up when MyAheart leapsin the sky;
So was it when my life began,
So is it now I am a man,
I behold
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.
ON HIS BLINDNESS
I
By John Milton
WHEN and consider how my light is spent
wide;
And that one talent which is death to hide,
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest he returning chide;
Doth God exact day-labor, light denied,

TO MILTON
I fondly ask? But Patience, to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need
Either man's work or his own gifts; who best Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best: his state Is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed,
And post o'er land and ocean without rest ;
They also serve who only stand and wait.

A FAREWELL
By Charles Kingsley
Yfairest child, I have no song to give you ;
No lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray;
Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you
For every day.
Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;
Do noble things, not dream them all day long:
Andso make life, death, and that vast forever
One grand, sweet song.
TO MILTON
By William Wordsworth
ILTON! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
afen
Of stagnant waters : altar, sword, and pen,
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
Oh! raise us up, return to us again;
Andgive us manners, virtue, freedom, power.

RETRIBUTION
Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart:
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
So didst thou travel on life's common way,
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart
The lowliest duties on herself did lay.

PERSEVERANCE
By Edward Fitzgerald

RETRIBUTION
By Henry W. Longfellow
HOUGH the mills of God grind slowly Yet they grind exceeding small;
Though with patience he stands waiting,
With exactness grinds he all.

THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
By Abraham Lincoln
President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which Dr. Eliot specially mentions in his introduction, while not a poem in form, embodies the loftiest conception of what true patriotism really is. For that reason this world classic is here inserted
at the head of patriotic poems.
FOURSCORE brought forth and on this sevencontinent years agoanew our fathers nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in agreat civil war, test- ing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to
dedicate a portion of that field as a final restingplace for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we
cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to

AMERICA
that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion ; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation,
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and
that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
AMERICA
By S. F. Smith
Ycountry, 'tis of thee,
Of thee I sing ;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the Pilgrims' pride;
From every mountain side,
Let Freedom ring.
My native country, thee- Land of the noble freeThy name I love ;
I love thy rocks and rills ,
Thy woods and templed hills ;
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.
Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees
Sweet Freedom's song;
Let mortal tongues awake,
Let all that breathe partake,
Let rocks their silence breakThe sound prolong.

STAR- SPANGLED BANNER
Our fathers' God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing ;
Long may our land be bright With Freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King.
THE STAR- SPANGLED BANNER
By Francis Scott Key
SAY, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's
last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the
perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in
air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was
still there :
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of thebrave?
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the
deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence
reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering
steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses ?

STAR- SPANGLED BANNER
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first
beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
Ahome and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps'
pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's
desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the Heaven- rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall
wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the
brave.

RULE BRITANNIA!
By James Thomson
HEN Britain first, at Heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main,
This was the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sing the strain:
Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!
Britons never will be slaves.
The nations not so blest as thee,
Must, in their turn, to tyrants fall;
Whilst thou shalt flourish, great and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
Rule Britannia! etc.
Still more majestic shalt thou rise,
More dreadful from each foreign stroke,
As the loud blasts that tear thy skies
Serve but to root thy native oak.
Rule Britannia! etc.

THE WATCH ON THE RHINE
Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame;
All their attempts to hurl thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame,
And work their woe-but thy renown.
Rule Britannia! etc.
To thee belongs the rural reign;
Thy cities shall with commerce shine;
All thine shall be the subject main,
And every shore encircle thine.
Rule Britannia! etc.
The Muses, still with Freedom found,
Shall to thy happy coast repair;
Blest Isle! with matchless beauty crowned,
And manly hearts to guard the fair.
Rule Britannia! etc.

THE MARSEILLAISE HYMN
Y
By Rougetde Lisle
Esons of freedom, wake to glory !
Hark! hark ! what myriads bid you rise !
Your childen, wives, and grandsires hoary,
Behold their tears and hear their cries !
Shall hateful tyrants, mischiefs breeding,
With hireling hosts, a ruffian band,
Affright and desolate the land,
While peace and liberty lie bleeding?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! all hearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling,
Which treacherous kings confederate raise ;
The dogs of war, let loose, are howling,
And lo! our fields and cities blaze;
And shall we basely view the ruin,
While lawless force, with guilty stride,
Spreads desolation far and wide,
With crimes and blood his hands embruing?
To arms ! to arms ! ye brave!
Th' avenging sword unsheathe;
March on! march on! allhearts resolved
Onvictory or death.
O Liberty! can man resign thee,
Once having felt thy generous flame?
Candungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee?
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?

NATIONAL HYMN OF NORWAY
Too long the world has wept, bewailing That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield,
But freedom is our sword and shield,

March on! march on! all hearts resolved
Onvictory or death.

All forward for Freedom! In terrible splendor She comes to the loyal who die to defend her ;
Her stars and stripes o'er the wild wave of battle Shall float in the heavens to welcome us on.
All forward! to glory, thro' life-blood is pouring,
Where bright swords are flashing, and cannons are
roaring,
Welcome to death in the bullet's quick rattle,
Fighting or falling shall freedom be won.
Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner !
Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free.
All forward! All forward!
All forward to conquer! Where free hearts are beating,
Death to the cowardwho dreams of retreating!

DANISH NATIONAL HYMN
Liberty calls us from mountain and valley;
Waving her banner she leads to the fight.
Forward! all forward! the trumpets are crying ;
The drum beats to arms, our old flag is flying ;
Stout hearts and strong hands around it shall rally,
Forward to battle, for God and the Right.
Hurrah for the banner! Hurrah for the banner!
Hurrah for our banner, the flag of the free.
DANISH NATIONAL HYMN

ING Christian stood by lofty mast,
In mist and smoke.
His sword was hammering so fast,
Thro' Gothic helm and brain it pass'd,
Then sank each hostile hulk and mast,
In mist and smoke.
"Fly," shouted they; "fly he who can!
Who braves of Denmark's Christian,
Who braves of Denmark's Christian the
stroke."
Nils Juel gave heed to th' tempest's roar,
Now is the hour!
He hoisted his blood-red flag once more,
And smote upon the foe full sore,
Andshouted loud thro' the tempest's roar,
"Now is the hour."
"Fly!" shouted they, "for shelter fly !
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy,
Of Denmark's Juel who can defy the power?"

SPANISH NATIONAL HYMN
North Sea! aglimpse of Wessel rent
Thy murky sky !
Then champions to thine arms were sent;
Terror and Death glared where he went;
From the waves was heard a wail, that rent
Thy murky sky !
From Denmark thunders Tordenskiol!
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul,
Let each to Heav'n commend his soul andfly.
Path of the Dane to fame and might!
Dark rolling wave!
Receive thy friend, who scorning flight,
Goes to meet danger with despite,
Proudly as thou the tempest's might,
Dark rolling wave!

Andwar and vict'ry be thine arms,
'Midwar and vict'ry, be thine arms mygrave.

For the laws are the people's salvation,
And our King as their servant shall reign.
For their country, true Spaniards will dare it,
Dare to perish for Liberty's cause
To the tories' destruction, we swear it!
Live forever the King andthe laws.

G
OD uphold thee, mighty Emperor,
Monarch of our Eastern land.

Till the laurel crown'd, a victor,
All hearts bow at thy command.
God uphold thee, and defend thee,

In the German heart shall ever
He the brightest memory be.
Till in other worlds, a welcome
Greets in blest eternity.
God defend thee, God attend thee,
Emperor, Franz, all hail to thee!
THE HAND OF LINCOLN
By Edmund Clarence Stedman
OOK on this cast and know the hand
That bore a nation in its hold :
From this mute witness understand
What Lincoln was-how large of mould.
The man who sped the woodman's team,
Anddeepest sunk the ploughman's share,
Andpushed the laden raft astream,
Of fate before him unaware.
This was the hand that knew to swing The axe-since thus would Freedom train
Her son-and made the forest ring,
Anddrove the wedge and toiled amain.
Firmhand, that loftier office took,
Aconscious leader's will obeyed,
And, when men sought his word and look,
With steadfast might the gathering swayed.

THE HAND OF LINCOLN
No courtier's toying with a sword,
Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute;
A chief's, uplifted to the Lord
When all the kings of earth were mute!
The hand of Anak, sinewed strong,
The fingers that on greatness clutch;
Yet, lo! the marks their lines along Of one who strove and suffered much.
For here in knotted cord and vein
I trace the varying chart of years ;
Iknow the troubled heart, the strain,
The weight of Atlas-and the tears.
Again I see the patient brow
That palm erewhile was wont to press ;
Andnow 'tis furrowed deep, and now
Made smooth with hope and tenderness.
For something of aformless grace
This moulded outline plays about;
Apitying flame, beyond our trace,
Breathes like a spirit, in and outThe love that cast an aureole
Round one who, longer to endure,
Called mirth to ease his ceaseless dole,
Yet kept his nobler purpose sure.
Lo, as I gaze, the statured man,
Built up from yon large hand, appears:
Atype that nature wills to plan
But once in all a people's years.

BATTLE HYMN
What better than this voiceless cast
To tell of such a one as he,
Since through its living semblance passed
The thought that bade a race be free !
BATTLE- HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC
M
By Julia Ward Howe
INE eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
Hehath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps ;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps ;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps ;
His day is marching on.
I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows
of steel:
"As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal :
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,
Since God is marching on."

THE FLAG GOES BY
Hehas sounded forth the trumpet that shall never
call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His
judgment-seat :
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him-be jubilant,
my feet!
Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across
the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you
and me:
As He died to make menholy, let us die to make
men free,
While God is marching on.

Ablare of bugles, aruffle of drums,
Aflash of color beneath the sky:
Hats off!

Blue and crimson and white it shines
Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.
Hats off!
The colors before us fly ;
But more than the flag is passing by.

Weary marches and sinking ships ;
Cheers of victory on dying lips ;
Days of plenty and years of peace;
March of a strong land's swift increase ;
Equal justice, right, and law,
Stately honor and reverend awe;
Sign of a nation, great and strong Toward her people from foreign wrong:
Pride and glory and honor-all Live in the colors to stand or fall.

Ablare of bugles, a ruffle of drums ;
And loyal hearts are beating high :

WARREN'S ADDRESS
Forhim nominstrel raptures swell ;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim ;
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.
WARREN'S ADDRESS TO THE
AMERICAN SOLDIERS
S
By John Pierpont
TAND! the ground's your own, my braves!
Will ye give it up to slaves?
Will ye look for greener graves?
Hope ye mercy still?
What's the mercy despots feel?
Hear it in that battle-peal!
Read it on yon bristling steel!
Ask it-ye who will.
Fear ye foes who kill for hire?
Will ye to your homes retire ?
Look behind you! they're afire!
And before you, see
Who have done it ! From the vale
On they come-And ! will ye quail?
Leaden rain and iron hail
Let their welcome be!

THE OLD FLAG
Inthe God of battles trust!
Die we may-and die we must;
But, O, where can dust to dust
Be consigned so well,
As where Heaven its dews shall shed
On the martyred patriot's bed,
And the rocks shall raise their head,
Of his deeds to tell !

THE OLD FLAG
By H. C. Bunner
FF with your hat as the flag goes by!
And let the heart have its say;
You're man enough for a tear in your eye That you will not wipe away.
You're manenough for a thrill that goes
To your very finger-tipsAy! the lump just then in your throat that rose Spoke more than your parted lips.
Lift up the boy on your shoulder high,
And show him the faded shredThose stripes would be red as the sunset sky If Death could have dyed them red.
The man that bore it with Death has lain
This twenty years and moreHe died that the work should not be in vain
Of the men who bore it before.

BARBARA FRIETCHIE
The man that bears it is bent and old,
And ragged his beard and grayBut look at his eye fire young and bold,
At the tune that he hears them play.
The old tune thunders through all the air,
And strikes right in to the heart ;
If ever it calls for you, boy, be there!
Be there, and ready to start.
Off with your hat as the flag goes by!
Uncover the youngster's head!
Teach him to hold it holy and high For the sake of its sacred dead.

BARBARA FRIETCHIE
By John Greenleaf Whittier
Pfrom the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn,
The clustered spires of Frederick stand Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.
Round about them orchards sweep,
Apple and peach tree fruited deep,
Fair as a garden of the Lord
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,
On that pleasant morn of the early fall When Lee marched over the mountain wall

BARBARA FRIETCHIE
Over the mountains, winding down,
Horse and foot into Frederick town.
Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,
Flapped in the morning wind; the sun Of noon looked down, and saw not one.
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the menhauled down;
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.
Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
Under his slouch hat left and right He glanced: the old flag met his sight.
"Halt! "-the dust-brown ranks stood fast;
"Fire!"-out blazed the rifle-blast.
It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;

BARBARA FRIETCHIE
She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.
"Shoot, if you must, this old grayhead,
But spare your country's flag," she said.
Ashade of sadness, ablush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;
The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman's deed and word:
"Who touches ahair of yon grayhead Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.
All day long through Frederick street Sounded the tread of marching feet ;
All day long that free flag tost Over the heads of the rebel host.
Ever its torn folds rose and fell
Onthe loyal winds that loved it well;
And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with awarm good-night.
Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
And the rebel rides on his raids no mora
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.

SHERIDAN'S RIDE
Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,
Flag of freedom and union wave!
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town.

SHERIDAN'S RIDE
By Thomas Buchanan Read
from the South at break of Uringing to winchester freshedismay,
The affrighted air with a shudder bore,
Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door,
The terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar,
Telling the battle was on once more,
And Sheridan twenty miles away.
And wider still those billows of war
Thundered along the horizon's bar ;
And louder yet into Winchester rolled The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,
Making the blood of the listener cold,
As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,
And Sheridan twenty miles away.
But there is a road from Winchester town,
Agood broad highway leading down;
And there, through the flush of the morning light,
Asteed as black as the steeds of night

SHERIDAN'S RIDE
Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight,
As if he knew the terrible need ;
He stretched away with his utmost speed ;
Hills rose and fell; but his heart was gay,
With Sheridan fifteen miles away.
Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering
South,
The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth;
Or a trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,
Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster.
The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,
Impatient to be where the battlefield calls ;
Every nerve of the charger was strained to full
play,
With Sheridan only ten miles away.
Under his spurning feet the road Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,
And the landscape sped away behind Like an ocean flying before the wind ;
And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,
Swept on with his wild eye full of fire.
But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire ;
He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,
With Sheridan only five miles away.
The first that the General saw were the groups
Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops.
What was done ? what to do? A glance told him
both.
Then, striking his spurs, with a terrible oath,

THE REPUBLIC
Hedashed down the line, 'mid a storm of huzzas,
And the wave of retreat checked its course there,
because
The sight of the master compelled it to pause.
With foam and with dust the black charger was
gray;
By the flash of his eye, and the red nostril's play,
He seemed to the whole great army to say,
"I have brought you Sheridan all the way
From Winchester down to save the day!"
Hurrah ! hurrah for Sheridan !
Hurrah! hurrah for horse and man!
And when their statues are placed on high,
Under the dome of the Union sky,
The American soldier's Temple of Fame
There with the glorious General's name,
Be it said, in letters both bold and bright,
"Here is the steed that saved the day
By carrying Sheridan into the fight,
From Winchester, twenty miles away!"

THE REPUBLIC
By Henry W. Longfellow
HOU, too, sail on, O Ship of State!
Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
We know what Master laid thy keel,

THE PILGRIM FATHERS
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,
What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
In what a forge and what a heat Were shaped the anchors of thy hope !
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
'Tis of the wave and not the rock ;
'Tis but the flapping of the sail,
And not a rent made by the gale !
In spite of rock and tempest's roar,
In spite of false lights on the shore,
Sail on nor fear to breast the sea !
Ourhearts, our hopes, are all with thee,
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,
Are all with thee are all with thee !

HE breaking waves dash'd high Onastern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky Their giant branches toss'd ;
And theheavy night hungdark The hills and waters o'er,
When aband of exiles moor'd their bark
Onthe wild New England shore,

THE PILGRIM FATHERS
Not as the conqueror comes,
They, the true-hearted, came;
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame;
Not as the flying come,
In silence and in fear ; -
They shook the depths of the desert gloom With their hymns of lofty cheer.
Amidst the storm they sang,
And the stars heard and the sea;
Andthesoundingaisles of thedimwoodsrang To the anthem of the free!
The ocean eagle soar'd Fromhis nest by the white wave's foam;
And the rocking pines of the forest roar'd- This was their welcome home!
There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band;—
Why had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood's land?
There was woman's fearless eye,
Lit by her deep love's truth ;
There was manhood's brow serenely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.
What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war ?
They sought a faith's pure shrine !

THE EVE OF WATERLO0
By Lord Byron
HERE was a sound of revelrybynight,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.
Athousand hearts beat happily; and when Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell :
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising
knell!
Didye not hear it? No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.
Onwith the dance! let joy be unconfined!
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure
meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet !
But hark ! that heavy sound breaks in once
more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before!
Arm! arm! it is it is the cannon's opening roar!

CONCORD HYMN
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago,
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness ;
And there were sudden partings, such as press The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn
could rise?
And there was mounting inhot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering
car
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
Andswiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
Andnear, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star ;
While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips, "The foe! They come! They come!"

CONCORD HYMN
By R. W. Emerson
Ythe rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
Andfired the shot heard round the world.

О САРТAIN! MY CAPTAIN
The foe long since in silence slept ;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps ;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set to-day a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.
О САРТAIN! MY CAPTAIN!
By Walt Whitman
CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is
The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we
sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim
and daring;
But O heart ! heart ! heart !
Othe bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies.
Fallen cold and dead.

A NATION'S STRENGTH
OCaptain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells ;
Rise up for you the flag is flung-for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager
faces turning;
Here Captain! dear father!
This arm beneath your head!
It is some dream that on the deck
You've fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage
closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with
object won;
Exult O shores, and ring O bells !
But I, with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE
Brave men who work while others sleep,
Who dare while others flyThey build a nation's pillars deep
And lift them to the sky.
THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE
By Charles Wolfe NOTSa drum was heard, not a funeral-note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning,
By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.
We thought as we hollowed his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his
head,
And we far away on the billow !

O CANADA!
Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,
And o'er his cold ashes upbraid himBut little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on In the grave where a Briton has laid him.
But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock struck the hour for retiring ;
Andweheard the distant and random gun
That the foe was sullenly firing.
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory ;
Wecarved not a line, and we raised not a stoneBut we left him alone in his glory.
O CANADA! *

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
By R. W. Gilder
HIS bronze doth keep the very form and THIS bron
Of our great martyr's face. Yes, this is he:
That brow all wisdom, all benignity;
That human, humorous mouth; those cheeks that
hold
Like some harsh landscape all the summer's gold;
That spirit fit for sorrow, as the sea
For storms to beat on; the lone agony

THE LIGHT BRIGADE
Those silent patient lips too well foretold.
Yes, this is he who ruled a world of men
As might some prophet of the elder dayBrooding above the tempest and the fray With deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken.
Apower was his beyond the touch of art Or armëd strength-his pure and mighty heart.

"Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Was there a man dismay'd?
Not tho' the soldier knew
Some one had blunder'd :
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die :
Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.

Cannon in front of them
Volley'd and thunder'd;
Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.
Flash'd all their sabers bare,
Flash'd as they turn'd in air Sab'ring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd:
Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel'd from the saber-stroke
Shatter'd and sunder'd.
Then they rode back, but not,
Not the six hundred.
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volley'd and thunder'd:
Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well Came through the jaws of Death Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of themLeft of six hundred.

PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
By Henry W. Longfellow
ISTEN, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly aman is now alive Who remembers that famous day and year.
He said to his friend "If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North-Church tower, as a signal-light- One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm."
Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar Silently row'd to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war :
Jun. Cl-10 323 11
PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
Aphantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And ahuge, black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
Meanwhile his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack-door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
Then he climb'd to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch On the somber rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade;
Up the light ladder, slender and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
Amoment on the roofs of the quiet town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapp'd in silence so deep and still,
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,
The watchful night-wind as it went Creeping along from tent to tent,
Andseeming to whisper, "All is well!"

PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
Amoment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bayAline of black, that bends and floats
Onthe rising tide, like abridge of boats.
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurr'd, with aheavy stride,
Onthe opposite shore walk'd Paul Revere.
Nowhe patted his horse's side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamp'd the earth,
Andturn'd and tighten'd his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watch'd with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely, and spectral, and somber, and still.
And, lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height,
Aglimmer, and then agleam of light !
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight Asecond lamp in the belfry burns!
Ahurry of hoofs in avillage street,
Ashape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a
spark
Struck out by asteed that flies fearless and fleet :
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and
the light,

PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
It was twelve by the village clock,
When he cross'd the bridge into Medford
town,
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer's dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.
It was one by the village clock,
When he rode into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock Swim in the moonlight as he pass'd,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and
bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.
It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning-breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.

NASEBY

You know the rest. In the books you have read How the British regulars fired and fled ;
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.
So through the night rode Paul Revere ;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm To every Middlesex village and farmAcry of defiance, and not of fear- Avoice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And aword that shall echo for evermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness, and peril, and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beat of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

NASEBY
By Thomas Babington Macaulay
WHEREFORE come ye forth in triumph
from the north,
With your hands, and your feet, and your raiment
all red?
And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous
shout?
And whence be the grapes of the wine-press that ye tread?

NASEBY
O, evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit,
And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod;
For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong,
Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God.
It was about the noon of a glorious day of
June
That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses
shine,
And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair,
And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine.
Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his
sword,
The General rode along us to form us for the
fight ;
When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled
into a shout
Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right.
And hark! like the roar of the billows on the
shore,
The cry of battle rises along their charging line :
For God! for the cause! for the Church ! for the
laws!
For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the
Rhine!

NASEBY
The furious German comes, with his clarions and
his drums,
His bravoes of Alsatia and pages of Whitehall ;
They are bursting on our flanks ! Grasp your
pikes! Close your ranks !
For Rupert never comes but to conquer, or to fall.
They are here they rush on-we are broken-we
are gone- Our left is borne before them like stubble on the
blast.
O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right!
Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to
the last!
Stout Skippen hath a wound-the center hath given ground.
Hark! hark! what means the trampling of horse- men on our rear ?
Whosebanner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God!
'tis he, boys !
Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here!
Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a
row,
Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the
dikes.
Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the
accurst,
And at a shock have scattered the forest of his
pikes.

NASEBY
Fast, fast the gallants ride, in some safe nook to
hide
Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar;
And he he turns ! he flies ! shame on those cruel
eyes
That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on
war!
Ho, comrades! scour the plain; and ere ye strip the
slain,
First give another stab to make your search secure;
Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad- pieces and lockets,
The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor.
Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold,
When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans
to-day;
And to-morrow shall the fox from her chambers in
the rocks
Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey.
Where be your tongues, that late mocked at heaven and hell and fate?
And the fingers that once were so busy with your
blades?
Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths?
Your stage-plays andyour sonnets, your diamonds and your spades ?

THE GOOD NEWS
Down! down! forever down, with the miter and the
crown!
With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of
the Pope!
There is woe in Oxford halls, there is wail in Durham's stalls ;
The Jesuit smites his bosom, the bishop rends his
cope.
And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's
ills,
And tremble when she thinks on the edge ofEng- land's sword;
And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear
What the hand of God hath wrought for the houses and the word!
HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD
NEWS FROM GHENT TO ΑΙΧ
I
By Robert Browning
SPRANG to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three ;
"Good speed!" cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew;
" Speed! " echoed the wall to us galloping through ;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.

THE GOOD NEWS
Not a word to each other ; we kept the great pace Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place ;
I turned in my saddle and made its girth tight,
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
'Twas moonset at starting ; but while we drew near Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear ;
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see ;
At Düffeld, ' twas morning as plain as could be ;
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the
half-chime,
So Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time ! "
At Aershot, up leaped of asudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one To stare through the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
With resolute shoulders, each butting away The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray ;
Andhis low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his
track ;
And one eye's black intelligence ever that glance O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance !
And the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and
anon
His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on.

THE GOOD NEWS
By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay
spur!
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,
We'll remember at Aix "-for one heard the quick
wheeze
Ofher chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering
knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky ;
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff ;
Till over by Dalhem adome-spire sprang white,
And " Gallop," gasped Joris, "forAix is in sight ! "
"How they'll greet us! "-and all in amoment his
roan
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone ;
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her
fate,
With nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called myRoland his pet-name, myhorse without
peer ;

THE BOWMAN'S SONG
:
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise,
bad or good,
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
And all I remember is-friends flocking round
As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the
ground;
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of
wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news
from Ghent.
THE BOWMAN'S SONG
By Arthur Conan Doyle
WHATof the bow? The bow was made in England:
Of true wood, of yew wood,
The wood of English bows ;
So men who are free
Love the old yew-tree
And the land where the yew-tree grows.
What of the cord?
The cord was made in England:
Arough cord, a tough cord,
Acord that bowmen love;
So we'll drain our jacks To the English flax And the land where the hemp was wove.

OLD IRONSIDES
T
What of the shaft?
The shaft was cut in England:
Along shaft, a strong shaft,
Barbed and trim and true ;
So we'll drink all together
To the gray goose feather,
And the land where the gray goose flew.
What of the men?
The men were bred in England:
The bowman-the yeomanThe lads of dale and fell.
Here's to you and to you!
To the hearts that are true
And the land where the true hearts dwell.
OLD IRONSIDES
By Oliver Wendell Holmes
HE mast that Britain strove to bow in vain;
And one who listened to the tale of shame,
Whose heart still answered to that sacred name,
Whose eye still followed o'er his country's tides Thy glorious flag, our brave Old Ironsides !
From yon lone attic, in a summer's morn,
Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn.
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
Andmany an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon's roar;-

THE DRUM
The meteor of the ocean air
Shall sweep the clouds no more.
Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
Whenwinds were hurrying o'er the flood,
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor's tread,
Or know the conquered knee ; -
The harpies of the shore shall pluck The eagle of the sea!
Oh, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set every threadbare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,
The lightning and the gale!
H
THE DRUM
By Bret Harte
ARK! I hear the tramp of thousands,
And of armèd men the hum;
Lo! a nation's hosts have gathered Round the quick alarming drumSaying, "Come,
Freemen, come,
Ere your heritage be wasted," said the quick alarmdrum.

THE DRUM
"Let me of my heart take counsel:
War is not of life the sum;
Who shall stay and reap the harvest When the autumn days shall come?"
But the drum
Echoed, " Come!
Death shall reap the braver harvest," said the sol- emn-sounding drum.
"But when won the coming battle,
What of profit springs therefrom?
What if conquest, subjugation,
Even greater ills become?"
But the drum
Answered, "Come!
You must do the sum to prove it," said the Yan kee-answering drum.
"What if, 'mid the cannon's thunder,
Whistling shot and bursting bomb,
When my brothers fall around me,
Should my heart grow cold and numb?"
But the drum
Answered, "Come!
Better there in death united, than in life a recreant,
-Come!"
Thus they answered-hoping, fearing,
Some in faith, and doubting some,
Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming,
Said, "My chosen people, come!"
Then the drum,
Lo! was dumb,
For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, an swered, "Lord, we come!"

CASABIANCA
By Felicia Dorothea Hemans
THE boy stood on the burning deck Whence all but he had fled ;
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
Shone round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm ;
Acreature of heroic blood,
A proud, though child-like form.
The flames rolled on-he would not go
Without his father's word ;
That father, faint in death below,
His voice no longer heard.
He called aloud, "Say, father, say,
If yet my task is done ? "
He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son.
" Speak, father ! " once again he cried,
" If I may yet be gone ! "
And but the booming shots replied,
And fast the flames rolled on.
Upon his brow he felt their breath,
And in his waving hair,
And looked from that lone post of death
In still, yet brave despair ;

DIVINE ODE
And shouted but once more aloud,
"My father ! must I stay?"
While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud,
The wreathing fires made way.
They wrapt the ship in splendor wild.
They caught the flag on high,
And streamed above the gallant child,
Like banners in the sky.
There came a burst of thunder soundThe boy-oh! where was he?
Ask of the winds that far around
With fragments strewed the sea!
With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
That well had borne their part- But the noblest thing that perished there Was that young faithful heart!
T
DIVINE ODE
By Joseph Addison
HE spacious firmament on high,
With all the blue ethereal sky,
And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
Their great Original proclaim:
Th' unwearied Sun from day to day
Does his Creator's power display,
And publishes to every land The work of an Almighty hand.

A HAPPY LIFE
Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
And nightly to the listening Earth Repeats the story of her birth :
Whilst all the stars that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole.
What though in solemn silence all
Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
What though nor real voice nor sound Amidst their radiant orbs be found?
In Reason's ear they all rejoice,
And utter forth a glorious voice,
For ever singing as they shine,
"The Hand that made us is divine."
:
THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY
LIFE
By Sir Henry Wotton
is he born and taught HowThathappy servethis not another's will;
Whose armor is his honest thought,
And simple truth his utmost skill ;
Whose passions not his masters are ;
Whose soul is still prepared for death,
Untied unto the world by care
Of public fame or private breath;

THE RHODORA
Who envies none that chance doth raise,
Nor vice ; who never understood
Howdeepest wounds are given by praise ;
Nor rules of state, but rules of good;
Who hath his life from rumors freed;
Whoseconscience is his strong retreat ;
Whose state can neither flatterers feed,
Nor ruin make oppressors great ;
Who God doth late and early pray
More of his grace than gifts to lend ;
And entertains the harmless day
With a religious book or friend.
This man is freed from servile bands
Of hope to rise or fear to fall :
Lord of himself, though not of lands,
And, having nothing, yet hath all.
THE RHODORA, ON BEING ASKED
WHENCE IS THE FLOWER
IN
By Ralph Waldo Emerson
N May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,
I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,
Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,
To please the desert and the sluggish brook.
The purple petals fallen in the pool
Made the black water with their beauty gay;
Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,

LAUS DEO
And court the flower that cheapens his array.
Rhodora ! if the sages ask thee why
This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,
Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing,
Then beauty is its own excuse for being;
Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!
I never thought to ask; I never knew;
But in my simple ignorance suppose The self-same power that brought me there, brought
you.
I
LAUS DEO
By John Greenleaf Whittier
T is done!
Clang of bell and roar of gun
Send the tidings up and down.
How the belfries rock and reel !
How the great guns, peal on peal,
Fling the joy from town to town!
Ring, O bells !
Every stroke exulting tells Of the burial hour of crime.
Loud and long, that all may hear,
Ring for every listening ear Of Eternity and Time!
Let us kneel :
God's own voice is in that peal,
And this spot is holy ground.
Lord, forgive us! What are we,
That our eyes this glory see,
That our ears have heard the sound!

LAUS DEO
For the Lord
On the whirlwind is abroad;
In the earthquake He has spoken;
He has smitten with His thunder
The iron walls asunder,
And the gates of brass are broken!
Loud and long
Lift the old exulting song ;
Sing with Miriam by the sea:
He has cast the mighty down;
Horse and rider sink and drown;
He has triumphed gloriously!
Did we dare,
In our agony of prayer,
Ask for more than He has done?
When was ever His right hand
Over any time or land Stretched as now beneath the sun?
How they pale,
Ancient myth and song and tale,
In this wonder of our days,
When the cruel rod of war
Blossoms white with righteous law,
And the wrath of man is praise!
Blotted out!
All within and all about
Shall a fresher life begin ;
Freer breathe the universe
As it rolls its heavy curse On the dead and buried sin.

THE COLORED BAND
It is done!
In the circuit of the sun
Shall the sound thereof go forth.
It shall bid the sad rejoice,
It shall give the dumb a voice,
It shall belt with joy the earth!
Ring and swing,
Bells of joy! On morning's wing Send the song of praise abroad!
With a sound of broken chains,
Tell the nations that He reigns,
Who alone is Lord and God!

THE WIND IN A FROLIC
By William Howitt
Tinderingsprangu
HE wind one morning sprang up from sleep,
a leap!
Now for a madcap galloping chase!
I'll make a commotion in every place!"
So it swept with a bustle right through a great
town,
Cracking the signs and scattering down Shutters ; and whisking, with merciless squalls,
Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.
There never was heard a lustier shout,
As the apples and oranges trundled about ;
And the urchins that stand with their thievish eyes For ever on watch, ran off each with a prize.
Then away to the field it went, blustering and humming,
Andthe cattle all wondered whatever was coming;
It plucked by the tails the grave matronly cows,
And tossed the colts' manes all over their brows ;
Till, offended at such an unusual salute,
They all turned their backs, and stood sulky and
mute.

THE WIND IN A FROLIC
So on it went capering and playing its pranks,
Whistling with reeds on the broad river's banks,
Puffing the birds as they sat on the spray,
Or the traveller grave on the king's highway.
It was not too nice to hustle the bags
Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags ;
'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke With the doctor's wig or the gentleman's cloak.
Through the forest it roared, and cried gaily, "Now,
You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"
And it made them bow without more ado,
Or it cracked their great branches through and through.
Then it rushed like a monster oncottage and farm,
Striking their dwellers with sudden alarm;
And they ran out like bees in a midsummer
swarm;-
There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over
their caps,
To see if their poultry were free from mishaps ;
Theturkeys theygobbled, the geese screamed aloud,
And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;
There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on,
Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to
be gone.
But the wind had swept on, and had met in a lane
Withaschoolboy, who panted and struggled invain;
For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and
he stood
With his hat in a pool and his shoes in the mud.

IVRY
Then away went the wind in its holidayglee,
And now it was far on the billowy sea,
And the lordly ships felt its staggering blow,
And the little boats darted to and fro.
But lo! it was night, and it sank to rest
On the sea-bird's rock in the gleaming West,
Laughing to think, in its fearful fun,
How little of mischief it really had done.
IVRY
By Thomas Babington Macaulay
Nowglory OW glory to the Lord of Hosts, from whom all glories are !
Andglory to our Sovereign Liege, King Henry of Navarre!
Now let there be the merry sound of music and of dance,
Through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vines, O
pleasant land of France!
And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city
of the waters,
Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters.
As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our
joy,
For cold, and stiff, and still are they who wrought
thy walls annoy.
Hurrah! Hurrah! a single field hath turned the
chance of war,
Hurrah ! Hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre.

IVRY
Oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,
We saw the army of the League drawn out in long
array ;
With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel
peers,
And Appenzell's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses
of our land;
Anddark Mayenne was in the midst, atruncheon in his hand;
And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,
Andgood Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,
To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.
The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor
drest,
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.
He looked upon his people, and atear was in his
eye;
He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.
Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,
Down all our line, a deafening shout, "God save our Lord the King!"

IVRY
"And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he
may,
For never saw I promise yet of such abloody fray,
Press where ye see mywhite plume shine, amid the ranks of war,
And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre."
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled
din
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roar- ing culverin.
The fiery Duke is pricking fast across St. André's plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and
Almayne.
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of
France,
Charge for the golden lilies now-upon them with
the lance.
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,
Athousand knights are pressing close behind the snow- white crest ;
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a
guiding star,
Amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of
Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne
hath turned his rein.
D'Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish count is slain.
34.9
IVRY
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a
Biscay gale ;
The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags,
and cloven mail.
And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along
our van,
"Remember St. Bartholomew! " was passed from
man to man.
But out spake gentle Henry, "No Frenchman is
my foe:
Down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go."
Oh! was there ever such aknight, in friendship or
in war,
As our Sovereign Lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre?
Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought
for France to-day;
Andmany a lordly banner God gave them for a
prey.
But we of the Religion have borne us best in fight;
And the good lord of Rosny has ta'en the cornet
white.
Our own true Maximilian the cornet white hath
ta'en,
The cornet white with crosses black, the flag of
false Lorraine.
Up with it high; unfurl it wide; that all the host may know
How God hath humbled the proud house which wrought His church such woe.

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest points of war,
Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry
of Navarre.
Ho! maidens of Vienna; Ho! matrons of Lucerne;
Weep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.
Ho! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls.
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your
Ho! burghers of St. Genevieve, keep watch and
arms be bright ;
ward to-night.
For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our Godhath
raised the slave,
And mocked the counsel of the wise, the valour of
the brave.
Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories
are;
Andglory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of
Navarre.
THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
By William E. Aytoun
I
T was upon an April morn,
While yet the frost lay hoar,
We heard Lord James's bugle-horn
Sound by the rocky shore.

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then down we went, a hundred knights,
All in our dark array,
And flung our armor in the ships
That rode within the bay.
We spoke not as the shore grew less
But gazed in silence back,
Where the long billows swept away
The foam behind our track.
And aye the purple hues decayed Upon the fading hill,
And but one heart in all that ship
Was tranquil, cold, and still.
The good Lord Douglas paced the deck,
And O, his face was wan!
Unlike the flush it used to wear
When in the battle-van.-
"Come hither, come hither, my trustyknight,
Sir Simon of the Lee ;
There is a freit lies near my soul I fain would tell to thee.
"Thouknow'st the words King Robert spoke Upon his dying day:
How he bade take his noble heart
And carry it far away;
"And lay it in the holy soil Where once the Saviour trod,
Since he might not bear the blessed Cross,
Nor strike one blow for God.

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"Last night as in my bed I lay,
I dreamed a dreary dream: -
Methought I saw a Pilgrim stand In the moonlight's quivering beam.
"His robe was of the azure dye,
Snow-white his scattered hairs,
And even such a cross he bore
As good St. Andrew bears.
""Why go ye forth, Lord James,' he said,
'With spear and belted brand?
Why do you take its dearest pledge From this our Scottish land?
" The sultry breeze of Galilee Creeps through its groves of palm,
The olives on the Holy Mount
Stand glittering in the calm.
" But 'tis not there that Scotland's heart
Shall rest by God's decree,
Till the great angel calls the dead To rise from earth and sea!
" Lord James of Douglas, mark my rede!
That heart shall pass once more
In fiery fight against the foe,
As it was wont of yore.
" And it shall pass beneath the Cross,
And save King Robert's vow ;
But other hands shall bear it back,
Not, James of Douglas, thou!'

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"Now, by thy knightly faith, I pray,
Sir Simon of the LeeFor truer friend had never man
Than thou hast been to me-
"If ne'er upon the Holy Land 'Tis mine in life to tread,
Bear thou to Scotland's kindly earth The relics of her dead. "
The tear was in Sir Simon's eye As he wrung the warrior's hand-
"Betide me weal, betide me woe,
I'll hold by thy command.
"But if in battle-front, Lord James,
'Tis ours once more to ride,
Nor force of man, nor craft of fiend,
Shall cleave me from thy side!"
And aye we sailed and aye we sailed
Across the weary sea,
Until one morn the coast of Spain
Rose grimly on our lee.
And as we rounded to the port,
Beneath the watch-tower's wall,
We heard the clash of the atabals,
And the trumpet's wavering call.
"Why sounds yon Eastern music here
So wantonly and long,
And whose the crowd of armed men
That round yon standard throng?"

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"The Moors have come from Africa
To spoil and waste and slay,
AndKing Alonzo of Castile
Must fight with them to-day."
"Now shame it were," cried good LordJames,
"Shall never be said of me
That I and mine have turned aside
From the Cross in jeopardie!
"Have down, have down, my merry men all- Have down unto the plain;
We'll let the Scottish lion loose
Within the fields of Spain! "
"Now welcome to me, noble lord,
Thou and thy stalwart power;
Dear is the sight of a Christian knight,
Who comes in such an hour!
"Is it for bond or faith you come,
Or yet for golden fee?
Or bring ye France's lilies here,
Or the flower of Burgundie?"
"God greet thee well, thou valiant king,
Thee and thy belted peersSir James of Douglas am I called,
And these are Scottish spears.
"We do not fight for bond or plight,
Nor yet for golden fee ;
But for the sake of our blessed Lord,
Who died upon the tree.
Jun. Cl-10 355 12
THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"We bring our great King Robert's heart
Across the weltering wave,
To lay it in the holy soil Hard by the Saviour's grave.
"True pilgrims we, by land or sea,
Where danger bars the way;
And therefore are we here, Lord King,
To ride with thee this day! "
The King has bent his stately head,
And the tears were in his eyne-
"God's blessing on thee, noble knight,
For this brave thought of thine !
"I know thy name full well, Lord James;
And honored may I be,
That those who fought beside the Bruce
Should fight this day for me!
"Take thou the leading of the van,
And charge the Moors amain;
There is not such a lance as thine
In all the host of Spain! "
The Douglas turned towards us then,
O, but his glance was high !
"There is not one of all mymen
But is as bold as I.
"There is not one of all my knights
But bears as true a spearThen onward, Scottish gentlemen,
And think King Robert's here!"

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE

The trumpets blew, the cross-bolts flew,
The arrows flashed like flame,
As spur in side, and spear in rest,
Against the foe we came.
And many a bearded Saracen
Went down, both horse and man;
For through their ranks we rode like corn,
So furiously we ran!
But in behind our path they closed,
Though fain to let us through,
For they were forty thousand men,
And we were wondrous few.
We might not see alance's length,
So dense was their array,
But the long fell sweep of the Scottish blade Still held them hard at bay.
"Make in! make in!" Lord Douglas cried-
"Make in, my brethren dear!
Sir William of St. Clair is down;
Wemay not leave him here!"
But thicker, thicker grew the swarm,
And sharper shot the rain,
And the horses reared amid the press,
But they would not charge again.
"Now Jesu help thee," said Lord James,
"Thou kind and true St. Clair!
An' if I may not bring thee off,
I'll die beside thee there!"

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
Then in his stirrups up he stood,
So lion-like and bold,
Andheld the precious heart aloft
All in its case of gold.
He flung it from him, far ahead,
And never spake he more,
But "Pass thou first, thou dauntless heart,
As thou wert wont of yore ! "
The roar of fight rose fiercer yet,
And heavier still the stour,
Till the spears of Spain came shivering in,
And swept away the Moor.
"Now praised be God, the day is won!
They fly o'er flood and fell- Why dost thou draw the rein so hard,
Good knight, that fought so well?"
"O, ride ye on, Lord King!" he said,
"And leave the dead to me,
For I must keep the dreariest watch
That ever I shall dree !
"There lies, above his master's heart,
The Douglas, stark and grim;
And woe is me I should be here,
Not side by side with him!
"The world grows cold, myarm is old,
And thin my lyart hair,
And all that I loved best on earth
Is stretched before me there.

THE HEART OF THE BRUCE
"O Bothwell banks! that blooms so bright Beneath the sun of May,
The heaviest cloud that ever blew
Is bound for you this day.
"And Scotland! thou mayst veil thy head
In sorrow and in pain:
The sorest stroke upon thy brow Hath fallen this day in Spain!
"We'll bear them back unto our ship,
We'll bear them o'er the sea,
And lay them in the hallowed earth Within our own countrie.
"And be thou strong of heart, Lord King,
For this I tell thee sure,
The sod that drank the Douglas' blood Shall never bear the Moor!"
The King he lighted from his horse,
He flung his brand away,
And took the Douglas by the hand,
So stately as he lay.
"God give thee rest, thou valiant soul!
That fought so well for Spain;
I'd rather half my land were gone,
So thou wert here again!"
We bore the good Lord James away,
And the priceless heart we bore,
And heavily we steered our ship Towards the Scottish shore.

HERVE RIEL
Ο
No welcome greeted our return,
Nor clang of martial tread,
But all were dumb and hushed as death
Before the mighty dead.
Welaid our chief in Douglas Kirk,
The heart in fair Melrose ;
Andwoful men were we that day- Godgrant their souls repose!
HERVÉ RIEL
By Robert Browning
Nthe sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,
Did the English fight the French-woe to France!
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro'
the blue,
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of
sharks pursue,
Rance,
Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the
With the English fleet in view.
'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;
First and foremost of the drove, inhis great ship,
Damfreville;
Close on him fled, great and small,
Twenty-two good ships in all ;

HERVE RIEL
And they signalled to the place "Help the winners of a race!
Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick- or, quicker still,
Here's the English can and will!"
Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt
on board;
"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these
to pass?" laughed they:
"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,
Shall the Formidable here with her twelve and
eighty guns Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of
twenty tons,
And with flow at full beside?
Now, ' tis slackest ebb of tide.
Reach the mooring? Rather say,
While rock stands or water runs,
Not a ship will leave the bay!"
Then was called a council straight Brief and bitter the debate :
"Here's the English at our heels; would you have
them take in tow
All that's left us of the fleet linked together stern and bow,
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
Better run the ships aground!"
(Ended Damfreville his speech. )

HERVE RIEL
"Not a minute more to wait !
Let the Captains all and each
Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!
France must undergo her fate.
"Give the word!" But no such word
Was ever spoke or heard;
For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
-A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate-first, second, third?
No such man of mark, and meet
With his betters to compete!
But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,
Apoor coasting-pilot he, Hervé Riel the Croisickese.
And, "What mockery or malice have we here?"
cries Hervé Riel :
"Are you mad, you Malouins? Areyou cowards,
fools or rogues ?
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the
soundings, tell On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every
swell
'Twixt the offing here and Grève where the river
disembogues?
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?
Morn and eve, night and day,
Have I piloted your bay,

HERVE RIEL
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of
Solidor.
Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were
worse than fifty Hogues!
Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe
me there's a way!
Only let me lead the line,
Have the biggest ship to steer,
Get this Formidable clear,
Make the others follow mine,
And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I
know well,
Right to Solidor past Grève,
And there lay them safe and sound;
And if one ship misbehave,
-Keel so much as grate the ground,
Why, I've nothing but my life-here's my head!"
cries Hervé Riel.
Not a minute more to wait.
" Steer us in, then, small and great!
Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!
cried his chief.
Captains, give the sailor place!
He is Admiral, in brief.
Still the north-wind, by God's grace!
See the noble fellow's face,
As the big ship with a bound,
Clears the entry like a hound,
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound!
See, safe through shoal and rock,
How they follow in a flock,

HERVE RIEL
Not a ship that misbehaves, not akeel that grates the ground,
Not a spar that comes to grief!
The peril, see, is past,
All are harbored to the last,
Andjust as HervéRielhollas "Anchor !" sure asfate Up the English come, too late !
So the storm subsides to calm:
They see the green trees wave
On the heights o'erlooking Grève.
Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.
"Just our rapture to enchance,
Let the English rake the bay,
Gnash their teeth and glare askance,
As they cannonade away!
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"
Howhope succeeds despair oneach Captain's countenance!
Out burst all with one accord,
"This is Paradise for Hell!
Let France, let France's King Thank the man that did the thing!"
What a shout, and all one word,
"Hervé Riel!"
As he stepped in front once more,
Not a symptom of surprise In the frank blue Breton eyes,
Just the same man as before.
Then said Damfreville, "My friend,
I must speak out at the end,
Though I find the speaking hard.

HERVE RIEL 1
Praise is deeper than the lips :
You have saved the King his ships,
You must name your own reward.
'Faith our sun was near eclipse!
Demand whate'er you will,
France remains your debtor still.
'Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville. "
Then abeam of fun outbroke
On the bearded mouth that spoke,
As the honest heart laughed through
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
"Since I needs must say my say,
Since on board the duty's done,
And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is
it but a run ?-
Since 'tis ask and have, I may- Since the others go ashoreCome! Agood whole holiday!
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore! "
That he asked and that he got nothing more.
Name and deed alike are lost :
Not a pillar nor a post In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
Not a head in white and black
On a single fishing-smack,
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
All that France saved from the fight whence
England bore the bell.

THE DESTRUCTION OF
SENNACHERIB
By Lord Byron
HE Assyrian came down like awolf on the
fold,
Andhis cohorts were gleaming inpurple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the
sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
Like the leaves of the forest when the Summer is
green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath
blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the
blast,
Andbreathed in the face of the foe as he passed;

THE FRENCH CAMP
Andthe eyes ofthe sleepers waxed deadly andchill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew
still!
Andthere lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his
pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf.
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust onhis mail.
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
Andthe idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!
INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP
YO
By Robert Browning
OU know, we French stormed Ratisbon
Amile or so away,
On a little mound, Napoleon Stood on our storming-day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow Oppressive with its mind.

THE FRENCH CAMP
Just as perhaps he mused "My plans That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes Waver at yonder wall"-
Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew Arider, bound on bound
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew Until he reached the mound.
Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
Byjust his horse's mane, a boy:
You hardly could suspect- (So tight he kept his lips compressed,
Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
Was all but shot in two.
"Well, " cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace We've got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon To see your flag-bird flap his vans Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him! " The chief's eye flashed; his
plans Soared up again like fire.
The chief's eye flashed; but presently Softened itself, as sheathes
Afilm the mother-eagle's eye When her bruised eaglet breathes ;

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
"You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride Touched to the quick, he said :
"I'm killed, Sire !" And his chief beside
Smiling the boy fell dead.
HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
By Thomas Babington Macaulay
LARSPORSENAOfClusium,
By the nine gods he swore That the great house of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.
By the nine gods he swore it,
Andnamed a trysting-day,
Andbade his messengers ride forth,
East and west and south and north,
To summon his array.
East and west and south and north
The messengers ride fast,
And tower and town and cottage
Have heard the trumpet's blast.
Shame on the false Etruscan
Who lingers in his home,
When Porsena of Clusium
Is on the march for Rome!
There be thirty chosen prophets,
The wisest of the land,
Who always by Lars Porsena
Both morn and evening stand.

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
Evening and morn the thirty Have turned the verses o'er,
Traced from the right on linen white
Bymighty seers of yore
;
And with one voice the thirty
Have their glad answer given
:
"Go forth, go forth
, Lars PorsenaGo forth, beloved of heaven!
Go, and return in glory To Clusium's royal dome,
And hang round Nurscia's altars
The golden shields of Rome
!"
And now hath every city Sent up her tale of men
;
The foot are fourscore thousand
,
The horse are thousands ten
.
Before the gates of Sutrium
Is met the great array
;
Aproud man was Lars Porsena Upon the trysting-day.
Now, from the rock Tarpeian,
Could the wan burghers spy
The line of blazing villages Red in the midnight sky.
The fathers of the city
,
They sat all night and day
,
For every hour some horseman came
With tidings of dismay.

370
HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
I wis, in all the senate
There was no heart so bold
But sore it ached, and fast it beat,
When that ill news was told.
Forthwith up rose the consul,
Up rose the fathers all ;
In haste they girded up their gowns,
And hied them to the wall.
They held a council, standing
Before the river-gate ;
Short time was there, ye well may guess.
For musing or debate.
Outspake the consul roundly :
" The bridge must straight go down;
For, since Janiculum is lost,
Naught else can save the town."
Just then a scout came flying,
All wild with haste and fear :
"To arms ! to arms ! sir consulLars Porsena is here. "
On the low hills to westward
The consul fixed his eye,
And saw the swarthy storm of dust
Rise fast along the sky.
But the consul's brow was sad,
And the consul's speech was low,
And darkly looked he at the wall,
And darkly at the foe :
"Their van will be upon us Before the bridge goes down;

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And if they once may win the bridge,
What hope to save the town?"
Then outspake brave Horatius,
The captain of the gate :
"To every man upon this earth Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds
For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his gods?
"And for the tender mother
Who dandled him to rest,
And for the wife who nurses
His baby at her breast,
And for the holy maidens Who feed the eternal flameTo save them from false Sextus That wrought the deed of shame?
"Hew down the bridge, sir consul,
With all the speed ye may;
I, with two more to help me,
Will hold the foe in play- In yon strait path a thousand May well be stopped by three.
Now who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?"
Then outspake Spurius LartiusARamnian proud was he:
"Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,
And keep the bridge with thee. "

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And outspake strong Herminius- Of Titian blood was he:
"I will abide on thy left side,
Andkeep the bridge with thee."
The three stood calm and silent,
And looked upon the foes,
Andagreat shout of laughter From all the vanguard rose ;
And forth three chiefs came spurring
Before that deep array;
To earth they sprang, their swords they
drew,
And lifted high their shields, and flew To win the narrow way.
Aunus, from green Tifernum,
Lord of the hill of vines ;
And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves Sicken in Ilva's mines ;
And Picus, long to Clusium Vassal in peace and war,
Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
From that gray crag where, girt with towers,
The fortress of Nequinum lowers O'er the pale waves of Nar.
Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
Into the stream beneath;
Herminius struck at Seius,
And clove him to the teeth ;
At Picus brave Horatius
Darted one fiery thrust

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms Clashed in the bloody dust.
Then Ocnus of Falerii
Rushed on the Roman three ;
And Lausulus of Urgo,
The rover of the sea;
And Aruns of Volsinium,
Who slew the great wild boar- The great wild boar that had his den
Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,
And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,
Along Albinia's shore.
Herminius smote down Aruns ;
Lartius laid Ocnus low;
Right to the heart of Lausulus
Horatius sent a blow:
" Lie there, " he cried, "fell pirate !
No more, aghast and pale,
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
The track of thy destroying bark;
No more Campania's hinds shall fly
To woods and caverns, when they spy
Thy thrice-accurséd sail ! "
But now no sound of laughter Was heard among the foes ;
Awild and wrathful clamor
From all the vanguard rose
Six spears' lengths from the entrance,
Halted that deep array,

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And for a space no man came forth
To win the narrow way.
But, hark ! the cry is Astur :
And lo! the ranks divide ;
And the great lord of Luna Comes with his stately stride.
Upon his ample shoulders Clangs loud the fourfold shield,
And in his hand he shakes the brand
Which none but he can wield.
He smiled on those bold Romans,
A smile serene and high ;
He eyed the flinching Tuscans,
And scorn was in his eye.
Quoth he, " The she-wolf's litter
Stand savagely at bay ;
But will ye dare to follow,
If Astur clears the way? "
Then, whirling up his broadsword With both hands to the height,
He rushed against Horatius,
And smote with all his might.
With shield and blade Horatius
Right deftly turned the blow.
The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh ;
It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh.
The Tuscans raised a joyful cry To see the red blood flow.

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
He reeled, and on Herminius
He leaned one breathing-space,
Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds,
Sprang right at Astur's face.
Through teeth and skull and helmet
So fierce a thrust he sped,
The good sword stood ahandbreadth out
Behind the Tuscan's head.
And the great lord of Luna
Fell at that deadly stroke,
As falls on Mount Avernus
Athunder-smitten oak.
Far o'er the crashing forest
The giant arms lie spread;
And the pale augurs, muttering low,
Gaze on the blasted head.
On Astur's throat Horatius
Right firmly pressed his heel,
Andthrice and four times tugged amain,
Ere he wrenched out the steel.
"And see," he cried, "the welcome,
Fair guests, that waits you here!
What noble Lucumo comes next
To taste our Roman cheer?"
But at his haughty challenge Asullen murmur ran,
Mingled with wrath and shame and dread,
Along that glittering van.
There lacked not men of prowess,
Nor men of lordly race,

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
For all Etruria's noblest
Were round the fatal place.
But all Etruria's noblest
Felt their hearts sink to see
On the earth the bloody corpses,
In the path the dauntless three ;
And from the ghastly entrance,
Where those bold Romans stood,
All shrank-like boys who, unaware,
Ranging a wood to start ahare,
Come to the mouth of the dark lair
Where, growling low, a fierce old bear Lies amidst bones and blood.
Was none who would be foremost
To lead such dire attack;
But those behind cried "Forward!"
And those before cried "Back!"
And backward now, and forward,
Wavers the deep array;
And on the tossing sea of steel
To and fro the standards reel,
And the victorious trumpet-peal
Dies fitfully away.
Yet one man for one moment
Strode out before the crowd;
Well known was he to all the three,
And they gave him greeting loud:
"Now welcome, welcome, Sextus !
Now welcome to thy home!
Why dost thou stay, and turn away?
Here lies the road to Rome."

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
Thrice looked he at the city;
Thrice looked he at the dead;
Andthrice came on in fury,
And thrice turned back in dread;
And, white with fear and hatred,
Scowled at the narrow way
Where, wallowing in a pool ofblood,
The bravest Tuscans lay.
But meanwhile axe and lever
Have manfully been plied;
And now the bridge hangs tottering Above the boiling tide.
"Come back, come back, Horatius !"
Loud cried the fathers all-
"Back, Lartius ! back, Herminius !
Back, ere the ruin fall !"
Back darted Spurius LartiusHerminius darted back;
And, as they passed, beneath their feet
They felt the timbers crack.
But when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more;
But with a crash like thunder
Fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck Lay right athwart the stream;
And a long shout of triumph Rose from the walls of Rome,

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
As to the highest turret-tops Was splashed the yellow foam.
And like a horse unbroken,
When first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard,
And tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb, and bounded,
Rejoicing to be free ;
Andwhirling down, in fierce career,
Battlement and plank and pier,
Rushed headlong to the sea.
Alone stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mindThrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus,
With a smile on his pale face ;
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena,
"Now yield thee to our grace!"
Round turned he, as not deigning Those craven ranks to see ;
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus naught spake he ;
But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river That rolls by the towers of Rome:
"OTiber! Father Tiber !
To whom the Romans pray,

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
ARoman's life, a Roman's arms,
Take thou in charge this day! "
So he spake, and, speaking, sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And, with his harness on his back,
Plunged headlong in the tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow Was heard from either bank,
But friends and foes in dumb surprise,
With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank;
And when above the surges
They saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
Andeven the ranks of Tuscany Could scarce forbear to cheer.
But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain,
And fast his blood was flowing;
Andhe was sore in pain,
And heavy with his armor,
And spent with changing blows;
And oft they thought him sinking,
But still again he rose.
Never, I ween, did swimmer,
In such an evil case,
Struggle through such a raging flood Safe to the landing-place ;
But his limbs were borne up bravely By the brave heart within,

HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
And our good Father Tiber
Bare bravely up his chin.
"Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus-
"Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day We should have sacked the town!"
"Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena,
"And bring him safe to shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before."
And now he feels the bottom;
Now on dry earth he stands ;
Now round him throng the fathers
To press his gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the river-gate,
Borne by the joyous crowd.
They gave him of the corn-land,
That was of public right,
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night;
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on highAnd there it stands unto this day To witness if I lie.
It stands in the comitium,
Plain for all folk to see381
HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE
Horatius in his harness,
Halting upon one knee;
And underneath is written,
In letters all of gold,
How valiantly he kept the bridge In the brave days of old.
And still his name sounds stirring
Unto the men of Rome,
As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
To charge the Volscian home;
And wives still pray to Juno For boys with hearts as bold
As his who kept the bridge so well In the brave days of old.
And in the nights of winter,
When the cold north-winds blow,
And the long howling of the wolves Is heard amidst the snow;
When round the lonely cottage
Roars loud the tempest's din,
And the good logs of Algidus Roar the louder yet within;
When the oldest cask is opened,
And the largest lamp is lit ;
When the chestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit ;
When young and old in circle
Around the firebrands close ;
When the girls are weaving baskets,
And the lads are shaping bows ;

AFTER BLENHEIM
When the goodman mends his armor,
And trims his helmet's plume ;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom;
With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.
IT
AFTER BLENHEIM
By Robert Southey
T was a summer evening ;
Old Kaspar's work was done,
And he before his cottage door
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round Which he beside the rivulet
In playing there had found;
He came to ask what he had found
That was so large and smooth and round.
Old Kaspar took it from the boy,
Who stood expectant by;
And then the old man shook his head,
And with a natural sigh "'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,
"Who fell in the great victory.

AFTER BLENHEIM
"I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;
And often when I go to plow The plowshare turns them out.
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory."
"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"
Young Peterkin he cries ;
And little Wilhelmine looks up With wonder-waiting eyes ;
"Now tell us all about the war,
Andwhat they fought each other for?"
"It was the English," Kaspar cried,
"Who put the French to rout;
But what they fought each other for I could not well make out.
But everybody said," quoth he,
"That 'twas a famous victory.
"My father lived at Blenheim then,
Yon little stream hard by ;
They burned his dwelling to the ground,
Andhe was forced to fly:
So with his wife and child he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.
"With fire and sword the country round Was wasted far and wide,
And many a childing mother then And new-born baby died:
But things like that, you know, must be At every famous victory.

LADY CLARE
"They say it was a shocking sight
After the field was won;
For many thousand bodies here
Lay rotting in the sun:
But things like that, you know, must be After a famous victory.
"Great praise the Duke of Marlboro' won
And our good Prince Eugene; "
-"Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!"
Said little Wilhelmine;
"Nay ... nay ... my little girl," quoth he,
"It was a famous victory!
"And everybody praised the Duke Who this great fight did win."
-"But what good came of it at last?"
Quoth little Peterkin:-
"Why, that I can not tell," said he,
"But 'twas a famous victory."
LADY CLARE
By Alfred Tennyson
Twas the time when lilies blow
And clouds are highest up in air,
Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
To give his cousin, Lady Clare.
I trow they did not part in scorn ;
Lovers long-betrothed were they,
They two will wed to-morrow morn;
God's blessing on the day!

LADY CLARE
"He does not love me for my birth,
Nor for my lands so broad and fair;
He loves me for my own true worth,
And that is well," said Lady Clare.
In there came old Alice the nurse,
Said, "Who was this that went from thee?"
"It was my cousin," said Lady Clare,
"To-morrow he weds with me."
"Oh, God be thanked!" said Alice the nurse,
"That all comes round so just and fair;
Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,
And you are not the Lady Clare."
"Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,"
Said Lady Clare, "that ye speak so wild?"
"As God's above," said Alice the nurse,
" I speak the truth: you are my child.
" The old Earl's daughter died at mybreast;
I speak the truth, as I live by bread!
I buried her like my own sweet child,
And put my child in her stead."
"Falsely, falsely have ye done,
Ο Mother, " she said, "if this be true,
To keep the best man under the sun
So many years from his due."
"Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
"But keep the secret for your life,
Andall you have will be Lord Ronald's
When you are man and wife."

LADY CLARE
"If I'm a beggar born," she said,
"I will speak out, for I dare not lie.
Pull off, pull off, the brooch of gold And fling the diamond necklace by!"
"Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
"But keep the secret all ye can."
She said, "Not so: but I will know
If there be any faith in man."
"Nay now, what faith?" said Alice the nurse,
"The man will cleave unto his right."
"And he shall have it," the lady replied,
"Though I should die to-night."
"Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!
Alas, my child, I sinned for thee."
“Ο Mother, Mother, Mother," she said,
"So strange it seems to me!
"Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,
My mother dear, if this be so,
And lay your hand upon my head,
And bless me, Mother, ere I go."
She clad herself in a russet gown,
She was no longer Lady Clare ;
She went by dale, and she went by down,
With a single rose in her hair.
The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought Leapt up from where she lay,
Dropt her head in the maiden's hand,
And followed her all the way.
Jun. Cl-10 387 16
LADY CLARE
Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:
"O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!
Why come you drest like a village maid,
That are the flower of the earth?"
"If I come drest like a village maid,
I am but as my fortunes are :
I am abeggar born," she said,
"And not the Lady Clare.”
"Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
"For I am yours in word and in deed;
Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
"Your riddle is hard to read."
Oh, and proudly stood she up!
Her heart within her did not fail:
She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes,
And told him all her nurse's tale.
He laughed a laugh of merry scorn ;
He turned and kissed her where she stood;
"If you are not the heiress born,
And I," said he, "the next in blood-
"If you are not the heiress born,
And I," said he, "the lawful heir,
We two will wed to-morrow morn,
And you shall still be Lady Clare."

THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
By Robert and Caroline Southey
George III and a Dying Woman in Windsor Forest
Ο
UTSTRETCHED
shade
beneath the leafy
Of Windsor forest's deepest glade,
Adying woman lay;
Three little children round her stood,
And there went up from the greenwood Awoful wail that day.
"O mother! " was the mingled cry, "
“O mother, mother ! do not die,
And leave us all alone."
"My blessed babes!" she tried to say,
But the faint accents died away In a low sobbing moan.
Andthen, life struggling hard with death,
And fast and strong she drew her breath,
And up she raised her head;
And, peering through the deep wood maze
With a long, sharp, unearthly gaze,
"Will she not come?" she said.
Just then, the parting boughs between,
Alittle maid's light form was seen,
All breathless with her speed;
And, following close, aman came on
(A portly man to look upon) ,
Who led a panting steed.

THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
"Mother ! " the little maiden cried,
Or e'er she reached the woman's side,
And kissed her clay-cold cheek- "I have not idled in the town,
But long went wandering up and down,
The minister to seek.
"They told me here, they told me there- I think they mocked me everywhere ;
And when I found his home,
And begged him on my bended knee To bring his book and come with me,
Mother! he would not come.
" I told him how you dying lay,
And could not go in peace away Without the minister ;
I begged him, for dear Christ his sake,
But O, my heart was fit to breakMother! he would not stir.
"So, though my tears were blinding me,
I ran back, fast as fast could be,
To come again to you ;
And here close by this squire I met,
Who asked (so mild) what made me fret ;
And when I told him true-
"" I will go with you, child, ' he said,
'God sends me to this dying bed'- Mother, he's here, hard by."
While thus the little maiden spoke,
The man, his back against an oak,
Looked on with glistening eye.

THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
The bridle on his neck hung free,
With quivering flank and trembling knee,
Pressed close his bonny bay;
Astatelier man, a statelier steed,
Never on greensward paced, I rede,
Than those stood there that day.
So, while the little maiden spoke,
The man, his back against an oak,
Looked on with glistening eye And folded arms, and in his look
Something that, like a sermon-book,
Preached-"All is vanity."
But when the dying woman's face Turned toward him with a wistful gaze,
He stepped to where she lay;
And, kneeling down, bent over her,
Saying, "I am a minister,
My sister ! let us pray."
And well, withouten book or stole,
(God's words were printed onhis soul!)
Into the dying ear He breathed, as 'twere an angel's strain,
The things that unto life pertain,
And death's dark shadows clear.
He spoke of sinner's lost estate,
In Christ renewed, regenerate- Of God's most blest decree,
That not a single soul should die Who turns repentant, with the cry "Be merciful to me."

THE GREENWOOD SHRIFT
He spoke of trouble, pain, and toil,
Endured but for a little while
In patience, faith, and loveSure, in God's own good time, to be Exchanged for an eternity
Of happiness above.
Then, as the spirit ebbed away,
He raised his hands and eyes to pray
That peaceful it might pass ;
And then the orphans' sobs alone Were heard, and they knelt, every one,
Close round on the green grass.
Such was the sight their wandering eyes
Beheld, in heart-struck, mute surprise,
Who reined their coursers back,
Just as they found the long astray,
Who, in the heat of chase that day,
Had wandered from their track.
But each man reined his pawing steed,
And lighted down, as if agreed,
In silence at his side;
And there, uncovered all, they stoodIt was a wholesome sight and good
That day for mortal pride.
For of the noblest of the land
Was that deep-hushed, bareheaded band;
And, central in the ring,
By that dead pauper on the ground,
Her ragged orphans clinging round,
Knelt their anointed king.

THE ARAB TO HIS FAVORITE
STEED
By Caroline E. Norton
Y beautiful! my
meekly by,
beautiful! that standest
dark and fiery eye,
With thy proudly arched and glossy neck, and
Fret not to roam the desert now, with all thy
wingéd speed;
Imay not mount on thee again-thou'rt sold, my Arab steed!
Fret not with that impatient hoof-snuff not the breezy wind- The farther that thou fliest now, so far am I behind;
The stranger hath thy bridle-rein-thy master hath his goldFleet-limbed and beautiful, farewell; thou'rt sold,
my steed, thou'rt sold.
Farewell! those free, untiréd limbs full many amile
must roam,
To reach the chill and wintry sky which clouds the stranger's home;
Some other hand, less fond, must now thy corn and
bed prepare,
Thy silky mane, I braided once, must be another's care!
The morning sun shall dawn again, but never more with thee
Shall I gallop through the desert paths, where we
were wont to be ;

THE ARAB
Evening shall darken on the earth, and o'er the
sandy plain Some other steed, with slower step, shall bear me
home again.
Yes, thou must go! the wild, free breeze, the bril- liant sun and sky,
Thy master's house-from all of these my exiled one must fly;
Thy proud dark eye will grow less proud, thy step become less fleet,
And vainly shalt thou arch thy neck, thy master's
hand to meet.
Only in sleep shall I behold that dark eye, glancing bright;-
Only in sleep shall hear again that step so firm and light;
And when I raise my dreaming arm to check or cheer thy speed,
Then must I, starting, wake to feel-thou'rt sold,
my Arab steed!
Ah! rudely, then, unseen by me, some cruel hand may chide,
Till foam-wreaths lie, like crested waves, along thy panting side:
And the rich blood that's in thee swells, in thy in- dignant pain,
Till careless eyes, which rest on thee, may count each starting vein.
Will they ill-use thee? If I thought-but no, it cannot be
Thou art so swift, yet easy curbed; so gentle, yet
so free:

THE ARAB
And yet, if haply, when thou'rt gone, my lonely heart should yearn- Can the hand which casts thee from it now command thee to return?
Return! alas! myArab steed! what shall thy master do,
When thou, who wast his all of joy, hast vanished
from his view?
When the dim distance cheats mine eye, and through the gathering tears
Thy bright form, for a moment, like the false
mirage appears ;
alone,
Slow and unmounted shall I roam, with weary step
Where, with fleet step and joyous bound, thou oft hast borne me on;
And sitting down by that green well, I'll pause and sadly think,
"It was here he bowed his glossy neck when last I
saw him drink!"
When last I saw thee drink-Away ! ! the fevered dream is o'erI could not live aday, and know that we should meet no more!
They tempted me, my beautiful ! for hunger's power is strongThey tempted me, my beautiful! but I have loved too long.
Who said that I had given thee up? who said that thou wast sold?
'Tis false 'tis false, my Arab steed! I fling them back their gold!

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET
Thus, thus, I leap upon thy back, and scour the
distant plains ;
Away! who overtakes us now shall claim thee for his pains!
THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET
By Samuel Woodworth
OW dear to this heart Howchildhood deathtod,
are the scenes of my
When fond recollection presents them to view!
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild- wood,
Andevery loved spot which my infancy knew!
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it,
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell,
The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it,
And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well- The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.
That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure,
For often at noon, when returned from the field,
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.
How ardent I seized it, with hands that were
glowing,
And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;
Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the
well396
LOCHINVAR
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.
How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,
As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips !
Notafullblushinggoblet could tempt me to leave it,
The brightest that beauty or revelry sips.
And now, far removed from the loved habitation,
The tear of regret will intrusively swell,
As fancy reverts to my father's plantation,
And sighs for the bucket that hangs in the wellThe old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well!
LOCHINVAR
By Sir Walter Scott
H, young Lochinvar is come out of the West;
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
Andsave his good broadswordheweapons hadnone;
He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for
stone;
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and adastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.

LOCHINVAR
So boldly he entered the Netherby hall,
'Mong bridesmen and kinsmen, and brothers and
all.
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword (For the poor craven bridegroom said never a
word) ,
"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"
"I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied.
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;
Andnow I am come, with this lost love of mine To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far That would gladly be bride to the young Lochin- var."
The bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up :
He quaffed off the wine, and he threwdownthecup.
She looked down to blush, and shelooked up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
He took her soft hand ere her mother could bar-
"Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.
So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
That never ahall such agalliard did grace;
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bride-maidens whispered, " Twere better by far To have natched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reached the hall door and the charger
stood near;
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur!
They'll have fleet steeds that follow!" quoth young Lochinvar.
There was mounting 'mong Græmes of the Neth- erby clan;
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;
There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee ;
But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they
see.
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,
Haveye e'er heard of gallantlikeyoungLochinvar?
THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
By Henry W. Longfellow
"SPEAK!
PEAK! speak! thou fearful guest!
Who, with thy hollow breast
Still in rude armor drest,
Comest to daunt me!
Wrapt not in Eastern balms,
But with thy fleshless palms Stretched, as if asking alms,
Why dost thou haunt me?"

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
Then from those cavernous eyes
Pale flashes seemed to rise,
As when the Northern skies
Gleam in December;
And, like the water's flow
Under December's snow,
Came a dull voice of woe
From the heart's chamber.
"I was a Viking old!
My deeds, though manifold,
No Skald in song has told,
No Saga taught thee !
Take heed that in thy verse
Thou dost the tale rehearse,
Else dread a dead man's curse;
For this I sought thee.
"Far in the Northern Land,
By the wild Baltic's strand,
I, with my childish hand,
Tamed the gerfalcon;
And, with my skates fast-bound,
Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,
That the poor whimpering hound
Trembled to walk on.
"Oft to his frozen lair
Tracked I the grizzly bear,
While from my path the hare
Fled like a shadow;
Oft through the forest dark

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
Followed the were-wolf's bark,
Until the soaring lark
Sang from the meadow.
"But when I older grew,
Joining a corsair's crew,
O'er the dark sea I flew
With the marauders.
Wild was the life we led;
Many the souls that sped,
Many the hearts that bled,
By our stern orders.
"Many a wassail-bout Wore the long Winter out;
Often our midnight shout
Set the cocks crowing,
As we the Berserk's tale
Measured in cups of ale,
Draining the oaken pail Filled to o'erflowing.
"Once as I told in glee
Tales of the stormy sea,
Soft eyes did gaze on me,
Burning yet tender ;
And as the white stars shine
On the dark Norway pine,
On that dark heart of mine
Fell their soft splendor.
"I wooed the blue-eyed maid,
Yielding, yet half afraid,

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
And in the forest's shade
Our vows were plighted.
Under its loosened vest
Fluttered her little breast,
Like birds within their nest
By the hawk frighted.
"Bright in her father's hall Shields gleamed upon the wall,
Loud sang the minstrels all,
Chanting his glory ;
When of old Hildebrand
I asked his daughter's hand,
Mute did the minstrels stand
To hear my story.
"While the brown ale he quaffed,
Loud then the champion laughed,
And as the wind-gusts waft
The sea-foam brightly,
So the loud laugh of scorn,
Out of those lips unshorn,
From the deep drinking-horn Blew the foam lightly.
"She was a Prince's child,
I but a Viking wild,
And though she blushed and smiled,
I was discarded!
Should not the dove so white
Follow the sea-mew's flight?
Why did they leave that night Her nest unguarded?
:

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
"Scarce had I put to sea,
Bearing the maid with meFairest of all was she
Among the Norsemen!-
When on the white sea-strand,
Waving his armed hand,
Saw we old Hildebrand,
With twenty horsemen.
"Then launched they to the blast,
Bent like a reed each mast,
Yet we were gaining fast,
When the wind failed us;
And with a sudden flaw
Came round the gusty Skaw,
So that our foe we saw
Laugh as he hailed us.
"And as to catch the gale
Round veered the flapping sail,
'Death!' was the helmsman's hail,
'Death without quarter !"
Midships with iron keel Struck we her ribs of steel ;
Down her black hulk did reel
Through the black water!
"As with his wings aslant,
Sails the fierce cormorant,
Seeking some rocky haunt,
With his prey laden,
So toward the open main,

THE SKELETON IN ARMOR
Beating to sea again,
Through the wild hurricane,
Bore I the maiden.
"Three weeks we westward bore,
And when the storm was o'er,
Cloud- like we saw the shore
Stretching to leeward;
There for my lady's bower Built I the lofty tower
Which to this very hour Stands looking seaward.
"There lived we many years;
Time dried the maiden's tears;
She had forgot her fears,
She was a mother ;
Death closed her mild blue eyes;
Under that tower she lies ;
Ne'er shall the sun arise
On such another.
"Still grew my bosom then,
Still as a stagnant fen!
Hateful to me were men,
The sunlight hateful!
In the vast forest here,
Clad in my warlike gear,
Fell I upon my spear,
Oh, death was grateful!
"Thus, seamed with many scars,
Bursting these prison bars,

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Up to its native stars
My soul ascended!
There from the flowing bowl
Deep drinks the warrior's soul,
Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!"
Thus the tale ended.
S
THE DESERTED VILLAGE
By Oliver Goldsmith
WEET Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,
Where health and plenty cheered the laboring
swain,
Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
And parting summer's lingering blooms delay'd:
Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,
Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,
How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green,
Where humble happiness endear'd each scene !
How often have I paused on every charm,
The shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,
The never-failing brook, the busy mill,
The decent church that topt the neighboring hill,
The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,
For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made.
How often have I blest the coming day,
When toil remitting lent its turn to play,
And all the village train, from labor free,
Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree ;
While many a pastime circled in the shade,
The young contending as the old survey'd;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Andmany a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground,
And sleights of art and feats of strength went
round;
And still as each repeated pleasure tired,
Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired;
The dancing pair that simply sought renown,
By holding out to tire each other down;
The swain, mistrustless of his smutted face,
While secret laughter titter'd round the place;
The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love,
The matron's glance that wouldthoselooks reprove :
These were thy charms, sweet village! sports like
these,
With sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please ;
These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,
These were thy charms-but all these charms are
fled.
Sweet, smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,
Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn!
Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,
And desolation saddens all thy green:
One only master grasps the whole domain,
Andhalf a tillage stints thy smiling plain.
No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,
But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;
Along thy glades, a solitary guest,
The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest ;
Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,
And tires their echoes with unvaried cries :
Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,
And the long grass o'ertops the moldering wall;
:

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,
Far, far away, thy children leave the land.
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;
Abreath can make them, as a breath has made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
Whenonce destroy'd, can never be supplied.
Atime there was, ere England's griefs began,
When every rood of ground maintain'd its man:
For him light labor spread her wholesome store,
Just gave what life required, but gave no more :
His best companions, innocence and health,
And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
But times are alter'd : trade's unfeeling train
Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain;
Along the lawn, where scatter'd hamlets rose,
Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose,
And every want to opulence allied,
And every pang that folly pays to pride.
These gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,
Those calm desires that ask'd but little room,
Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful
scene,
Lived in each look, and brighten'd all the greenThese, far departing, seek a kinder shore,
And rural mirth and manners are no more.
Sweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,
Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Here, as I take my solitary rounds,
Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds,
And, many a year elapsed, return to view Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew.
Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,
Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.
In all my wand'rings round this world of care,
In all my griefs and God has given my share- I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
To husband out life's taper at the close,
And keep the flame from wasting, by repose :
I still had hopes for pride attends us still- Amidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,
Around my fire an evening group to draw,
And tell of all I felt and all I saw;
And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,
Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,
I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
Here to return and die at home at last.
O, blest retirement, friend to life's decline,
Retreats from care that never must be mine!
How happy he who crowns, in shades like these,
Ayouth of labor with an age of ease;
Who quits a world where strong temptations
try,
And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!
For him no wretches, born to work and weep,
Explore the mine, or tempt the dang'rous deep ;
No surly porter stands in guilty state,
To spurn imploring famine from the gate:

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
But on he moves to meet his latter end,
Angels around befriending virtue's friend ;
Bends to the grave with unperceived decay,
While resignation gently slopes the way ;
And, all his prospects brightening to the last,
His heaven commences ere the world be past !
Sweet was the sound, when oft, at evening's
close,
Up yonder hill the village murmur rose :
There, as I pass'd with careless steps and slow,
The mingling notes came soften'd from below ;
The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,
The sober herd that low'd to meet their young ;
The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,
The playful children just let loose from school :
The watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind,
And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind,
These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,
And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made.
But now the sounds of population fail,
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,
No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,
But all the bloomy flush of life is fled !
All but you widow'd, solitary thing,
That feebly bends beside the plashy spring ;
She, wretched matron, forced in age, for bread,
To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,
To pick her wintry fagot from the thorn,
To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn ;
She only left, of all the harmless train,
The sad historian of the pensive plain.

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
And still where many agarden flower grows wild,
There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
Aman he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich with forty pounds a year:
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had changed, nor wish'd to change, his place;
Unpractis'd he to fawn, or seek for power,
By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;
Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,
More skill'd to raise the wretched than to rise.
His house was known to all the vagrant train,
He chid their wand'rings, but relieved their pain:
The long remember'd beggar was his guest,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;
The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away,
Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were
won.
Pleased with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their woe:
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere charity began.
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And e'en his failings lean'd to virtue's side;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
But in his duty prompt at every call;
He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for
all;
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,
The reverend champion stood. At his control,
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
Andhis last faltering accents whisper'd praise.
At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorn'd the venerable place;
Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,
And fools who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
E'en children followed, with endearing wile,
And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.
His ready smile aparent's warmth exprest,
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distrest ;
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.
As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm.
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
The village master taught his little school.
Aman severe he was, and stern to view;
I knew him well, and every truant knew:
Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace The day's disasters in his morning face;
Full well they laugh'd, with counterfeited glee,
At all his jokes, for many ajoke had he;
Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd:
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,
The love he bore to learning was in fault.
The village all declared how much he knew;
'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
And e'en the story ran-that he could gauge:
Inarguing, too, the parson own'd his skill,
For ev'n though vanquish'd he could argue still ;
While words of learned length, and thund'ring sound,
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew That one small head could carry all he knew.
But past is all his fame. The very spot Wheremany atime he triumph'd, is forgot.
Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,
Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,
Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts in- spired,
Where graybeard mirth, and smiling toil retired,

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Where village statesmentalk'd withlooks profound,
And news much older than their ale went round.
Imagination fondly stoops to trace The parlor splendors of that festive place :
The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,
The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;
The chest contrived adouble debt to pay,
Abed by night, a chest of drawers by day;
The pictures placed for ornament and use,
The Twelve Good Rules, the Royal Game of Goose;
The hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,
With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay,
While broken teacups, wisely kept for show,
Ranged o'er the chimney, glisten'd in a row.
Vain transitory splendors ! Could not all Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall ?
Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart An hour's importance to the poor man's heart :
Thither no more the peasant shall repair,
To sweet oblivion of his daily care;
No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,
No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail ;
No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,
Relax his pond'rous strength, and lean to hear;
The host himself no longer shall be found
Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;
Nor the coy maid, half willing to be pressed,
Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.
Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,
These simple blessings of the lowly train;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
One native charm, than all the gloss of art.
Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play,
The soul adopts, and owns their firstborn sway;
Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,
Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined :
But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,
With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd- In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,
The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
And, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,
The heart, distrusting, asks if this be joy?
Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,
'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand
Between a splendid and ahappy land.
Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted
ore,
And shouting Folly hails them from her shore ;
Hoards, e'en beyond the miser's wish, abound,
And rich men flock from all the world around.
Yet, count our gains. This wealth is but aname That leaves our useful products still the same.
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds ;
Space for his horses, equipage and hounds :
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,
Has robb'd the neighboring fields of half their growth;
His seat, where solitary sports are seen,
Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Around the world each needful product flies,
For all the luxuries the world supplies:-
While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure, all In barren splendor feebly waits the fall.
As some fair female, unadorn'd and plain,
Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,
Slights every borrow'd charm that dress supplies,
Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes ;
But when those charms are past-for charms are
frailWhen time advances, and when lovers fail,
She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,
In all the glaring impotence of dress :
Thus fares the land, by luxury betray'd;
In Nature's simplest charms at first array'd:
But verging to decline, its splendors rise,
Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise ;
While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,
The mournful peasant leads his humble band;
And while he sinks, without one arm to save,
The country blooms-a garden, and agrave.
Where, then, ah! where, shall Poverty reside,
To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?
If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd,
He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,
Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,
And ev'n the bare-worn common is denied.
If to the city sped-what waits him there?
To see profusion that he must not share ;
To see ten thousand baneful arts combined
To pamper luxury and thin mankind;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
To see those joys the sons of pleasure know Extorted from his fellow-creatures' woe.
Here, while the courtier glitters in brocade,
There the pale artist plies his sickly trade;
Here, while the proud their long-drawn pomp dis- play,
There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.
The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight
reign,
Here, richly deck'd, admits the gorgeous train;
Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,
The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.
Sure, scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy,
Sure, these denote one universal joy!
Are these thy serious thoughts ?-Ah, turn thine
eyes
Where the poor houseless shivering female lies :
She once, perhaps, in village plenty blest,
Has wept at tales of innocence distrest ;
Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:
Now lost to all-her friends, her virtue fled,
Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,
And, pinch'd with cold and shrinking from the shower,
With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,
When idly first, ambitious of the town,
She left her wheel and robes of country brown.
Do thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,
Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?
E'en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,
At proud men's doors they ask alittle bread!

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,
Where half the convex world intrudes between,
Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they
go,
Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.
Far different there from all that charm'd before,
The various terrors of that horrid shore ;
Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,
And fiercely shed intolerable day;
Those matted woods, where birds forget to sing,
But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling ;
Those poisonous fields, with rank luxuriance crown'd,
Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;
Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake ;
Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,
And savage men, more murd'rous still than they;
While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,
Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.
Far different these from every former scene,
The cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,
The breezy covert of the warbling grove,
That only shelter'd thefts of harmless love.
Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that part
ing day That call'd them from their native walks away;
When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,
Hung round their bowers, and fondly look'd their
last,
And took a long farewell, and wish'd in vain For seats like these beyond the western main;

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
And, shuddering still to face the distant deep,
Return'd and wept, and still return'd to weep ! The good old sire, the first prepared to go To new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;
But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,
He only wish'd for worlds beyond the grave :
His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,
The fond companion of his helpless years,
Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,
And left a lover's for a father's arms:
With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,
And blest the cot where every pleasure rose ;
And kiss'd her thoughtless babes with many a
tear,
Andclasped them close, in sorrow doubly dear;
Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
In all the silent manliness of grief.
Ο Luxury, thou cursed by Heaven's decree,
How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!
How do thy potions, with insidious joy,
Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!
Kingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,
Boast of a florid vigor not their own:
At every draught more large and large they grow,
Abloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;
Till, sapp'd their strength, and every part unsound,
Down, down they sink, and spread aruin round.
E'en now the devastation is begun,
And half the business of destruction done;
E'en now, methinks, as pond'ring here I stand,
I see the rural virtues leave the land.

THE DESERTED VILLAGE
Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the snil,
That idly waiting flaps with every gale,
Downward they move, amelancholy band,
Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand:
Contented toil, and hospitable care,
Andkind connubial tenderness are there;
And piety, with wishes placed above,
And steady loyalty, and faithful love.
And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,
Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;
Unfit, in these degenerate times of shame,
To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;
Dear, charming nymph, neglected and decried,
My shame in crowds, my solitary pride ;
Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,
That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me
so;
Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,
Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well !
Farewell; and O! where'er thy voice be tried,
On Torno's cliffs, or Pambamarca's side,
Whether where equinoctial fervors glow,
Orwinter wraps the polar world in snow,
Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,
Redress the rigors of th' inclement clime ;
Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain ;
Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;
Teach him, that states of native strength possess'd,
Though very poor, may still be very blessed;
That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,
As ocean sweeps the labor'd mole away;
While self-dependent power can time defy,
As rocks resist the billows and the sky.

THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
I
By Henry W. Longfellow
T was the schooner Hesperus That sailed the wintry sea;
And the skipper had taken his little daughter To bear him company.
Blue were her eyes as the fairy- flax,
Her cheeks like the dawn of day,
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,
That ope in the month of May.
The skipper he stood beside the helm,
His pipe was in his mouth,
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
The smoke now west, now south.
Then up and spake an old sailòr Hadsailed to the Spanish main,
" I pray thee put into yonder port,
For I fear a hurricane.
"Last night the moon had a golden ring,
And to-night no moon we see!"
The skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe,
And a scornful laugh laughed he.
Colder and colder blew the wind,
Agale from the northeast;
The snow fell hissing in the brine,
And the billows frothed like yeast.

WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
Down came the storm, and smote amain
The vessel in its strength ;
She shuddered and paused likeafrightenedsteed,
Then leaped her cable's length.
"Come hither ! come hither ! my little daughtèr,
And do not tremble so ;
For I can weather the roughest gale
That ever wind did blow. "
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat Against the stinging blast;
He cut a rope from a broken spar,
And bound her to the mast.
"O father ! I hear the church-bells ring;
Oh say, what may it be?"
" 'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"
And he steered for the open sea.
"O father! I hear the sound of guns;
Oh say, what may it be?"
"Some ship in distress, that cannot live
In such an angry sea! "
"O father! I see agleaming light;
Oh say, what may it be?"
But the father answered never a word,
A frozen corpse was he.
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,
With his face turned to the skies,
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
On his fixed and glassy eyes.

WRECK OF THE HESPERUS
Then the maiden clasped herhands and prayed That savèd she might be;
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the waves
On the Lake of Galilee.
And fast through the midnight dark and drear,
Through the whistling sleet and snow,
Like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept Towards the reef of Norman's Woe.
And ever the fitful gusts between Asound came from the land;
It was the sound of the trampling surf On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
The breakers were right beneath her bows,
She drifted a dreary wreck,
And awhooping billow swept the crew Like icicles from her deck.
She struck where the white and fleecy waves
Looked soft as carded wool,
But the cruel rocks they gored her side
Like the horns of an angry bull.
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,
With the masts went by the board;
Like a vessel of glass she stove and sank- Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach A fisherman stood aghast To see the form of a maiden fair
Lashed close to adrifting mast.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
The salt sea was frozen on her breast,
The salt tears in her eyes ;
Andhe saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,
On the billows fall and rise.
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus In the midnight and the snow!
Christ save us all from a death like this
On the reef of Norman's Woe!
THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT
MARINER
I
By Samuel Taylor Coleridge
PART I
T is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din."
He holds him with his skinny hand,
"There was a ship," quoth he.
"Hold off ! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
He holds him with his glittering eye- The Wedding-Guest stood still,

THE ANCIENT MARINER
And listens like a three years' child :
The Mariner hath his will.
The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone :
He cannot choose but hear ;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.
" The ship was cheered, the harbor cleared,
Merrily did we drop Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the lighthouse top.
"The sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he !
And he shone bright, and on the right Went down into the sea.
"Higher and higher every day Till over the mast at noonThe Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.
The bride hath paced into the hall,
Red as a rose is she ;
Nodding their heads before her goes The merry minstrelsy.
The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot choose but hear ;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.
"And now the Storm-blast came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:

THE ANCIENT MARINER
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
And chased us south along.
"With sloping masts and dipping prow,
As who pursued with yell and blow
Still treads the shadow of his foe,
And forward bends his head,
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we fled.
"And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold :
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as emerald.
"And through the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen :
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken- The ice was all between.
"The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around :
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in a swound !
"At length did cross an Albatross,
Thorough the fog it came ;
As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hailed it in God's name.
"It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
And round and round it flew.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;
The helmsman steered us through!
"And agood south wind sprung up bebind ,
The Albatross did follow,
And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariners' hollo!
"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine ;
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white Glimmered the white moon-shine."
"God save thee, ancient Mariner !
From the fiends, that plague thee thus !
Why look'st thou so?"-With mycross-bow I shot the Albatross.
PART II
The Sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.
And the good south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariners' hollo!
And I had done ahellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow!
Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:
Then all averred, I had killed the bird
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,
That bring the fog and mist.
The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free;
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.
Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be ;
And we did speak only to break The silence of the sea !
All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.
Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean.
Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor anydrop to drink.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.
About, about, in reel and rout
The death- fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.
And some in dreams assurèd were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so,
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.
Andevery tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root ;
We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot.
Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.
PART III
There passed a weary time. Each throat Was parched, and glazed each eye.
Aweary time! A weary time!
How glazed each weary eye,
When looking westward, I beheld Asomething in the sky.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist ;
It moved and moved, and took at last
Acertain shape, I wist.
Aspeck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could nor laugh nor wail ;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in,
As they were drinking all.
See! see ! ( I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel !
The western wave was all a-flame,
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
( Heaven's Mother send us grace! )
As if through adungeon-grate he peered With broad and burning face.
Alas ! ( thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears !
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres?
Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through agrate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a Death? and are there two?
Is Death that woman's mate?
Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold : gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.
The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;
"The game is done! I've won! I've won!"
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.
The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,
Off shot the spectre-bark.
We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,

THE ANCIENT MARINER
My life-blood seemed to sip !
The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed
white;
From the sails the dew did drip- Till clomb above the eastern bar
The horned Moon, with one bright star Within the nether tip.
One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
And cursed me with his eye.
Four times fifty living men,
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.
The souls did from their bodies fly- They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul, it passed me by,
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!
PART IV
"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!
I fear thy skinny hand!
And thou art long, and lank, and brown,
As is the ribbed sea-sand.
"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,
And thy skinny hand, so brown. "-

THE ANCIENT MARINER
Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!
This body dropt not down.
Alone, alone, all, all alone,
Alone on a wide wide sea!
And never a saint took pity on My soul in agony.
The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie :
And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on; and so did I.
I looked upon the rotting sea,
And drew my eyes away;
I looked upon the rotting deck,
And there the dead men lay.
I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
Awicked whisper came, and made
Myheart as dry as dust.
I closed my lids, and kept them close,
And the balls like pulses beat ;
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky Lay like a load onmyweary eye,
And the dead were at my feet.
The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
Nor rot nor reek did they :
The look with which they looked on me
Had never passed away.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
An orphan's curse would drag to hell Aspirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is the curse in adead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.
The moving Moon went up the sky,
And no where did abide :
Softly she was going up,
And a star or two besideHer beams bemocked the sultry main,
Like April hoar-frost spread;
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
Astill and awful red.
Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes :
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes.
Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire :
Blue glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire.
Ohappy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare :
Aspring of love gushed from myheart,
And I blessed them unaware:

THE ANCIENT MARINER
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I blessed them unaware.
The selfsame moment I could pray;
And from my neck so free
The Albatross fell off, and sank
Like lead into the sea.
PART
Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,
Beloved from pole to pole!
To Mary Queen the praise be given!
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,
That slid into my soul.
The silly buckets on the deck,
That had so long remained,
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
And when I awoke, it rained.
My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
Andstill mybody drank.
I moved, and could not feel my limbs :
I was so light-almost I thought that I had died in sleep,
Andwas ablessed ghost.
And soon I heard aroaring wind:
It did not come anear;

THE ANCIENT MARINER
But with its sound it shook the sails,
That were so thin and sere.
The upper air burst into life !
And ahundred fire-flags sheen,
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out,
The wan stars danced between.
And the coming wind did roar more loud,
And the sails did sigh like sedge;
And the rain poured down from one black
cloud;
The Moon was at its edge.
The thick black cloud was cleft, and still The Moon was at its side:
Like waters shot from some high crag,
The lightning fell with never a jag,
Ariver steep and wide.
The loud wind never reached the ship,
Yet now the ship moved on!
Beneath the lightning and the Moon The dead men gave a groan.
They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes ;
It had been strange, even in a dream,
To have seen those dead men rise.
The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;
Yet never a breeze up blew;

THE ANCIENT MARINER
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do;
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools- Wewere a ghastly crew.
The body of my brother's son Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope But he said nought to me.
"I fear thee, ancient Mariner! "
Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest !
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,
Which to their corses came again,
But a troop of spirits blest :
Forwhen it dawned-they dropped their arms And clustered round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowlythrough theirmouths And from their bodies passed.
Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the Sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mixed, now one by one.
Sometimes a-dropping from the sky Iheard the sky-lark sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning!
And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;

THE ANCIENT MARINER
And now it is an angel's song,
That makes the heavens be mute.
It ceased; yet still the sails made on
Apleasant noise till noon,
Anoise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.
Till noon we quietly sailed on,
Yet never a breeze did breathe :
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,
Moved onward from beneath.
Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,
The spirit slid: and it was he
That made the ship to go.
The sails at noon left off their tune,
And the ship stood still also.
The Sun, right up above the mast,
Had fixed her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir,
With a short uneasy motionBackwards and forwards half her length With a short uneasy motion.
Then like a pawing horse let go,
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head,
And I fell down in aswound.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life returned,
I heard and in my soul discerned Two voices in the air.
"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
Byhim who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low
The harmless Albatross.
"The spirit who bideth by himself In the land of mist and snow,
Heloved the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow."
The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quothhe, "The manhath penancedone,
Andpenance more will do."
PART VI
First Voice
"But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewingWhat makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the ocean doing?"
Second Voice
"Still as a slave before his lord,
The ocean hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently,
Up to the moon is cast438
THE ANCIENT MARINER
" If he may know which way to go ;
For she guides him smooth or grim.
See, brother, see ! how graciously She looketh down on him."
First Voice
"But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without or wave or wind ? "
Second Voice
"The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind.
" Fly, brother, fly ! more high, more high !
Or we shall be belated :
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated. "
I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather :
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high,
The dead men stood together.
All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter :
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.
The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away :
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
And now this spell was snapt : once more I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw Of what had else been seenLike one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.
But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made :
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.
It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring- It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.
Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too :
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze- On me alone it blew.
Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed The light-house top Isee ?
Is this the hill ? is this the kirk ?
Is this mine own countree ?
Wedrifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray440
THE ANCIENT MARINER
O let me awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.
The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn !
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the Moon.
The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
That stands above the rock :
The moonlight steeped in silentness The steady weathercock.
And the bay was white with silent light
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.
Alittle distance from the prow Those crimson shadows were :
I turned my eyes upon the deck- Oh, Christ ! what saw I there !
Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat And, by the holy rood !
Aman all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.
This seraph-band, each waved his hand :
It was a heavenly sight !
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light ;

THE ANCIENT MARINER
This seraph-band, each wavedhis hand,
No voice did they impart- No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on myheart.
But soon I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the Pilot's cheer ;
Myhead was turned perforce away,
And I saw a boat appear.
The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was ajoy The dead men could not blast.
I saw a third-I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away The Albatross's blood.
PART VII
This Hermit good lives in that wood Which slopes down to the sea.
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with marineres
That come from a far countree.
He kneels at morn, and noon, and eveHe hath a cushion plump :
It is the moss that wholly hides The rotted old oak-stump.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,
"Why, this is strange, I trow!
Where are those lights so many andfair,
That signal made but now?"
"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said- "And they answered not our cheer!
The planks looked warped! and see those sails,
How thin they are and sere!
I never saw aught like to them,
Unless perchance it were
"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
My forest-brook along;
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,
Andthe owlet whoops to the wolf below,
That eats the she-wolf's young."
"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look-
(The Pilot made reply)
I am a-feared"-"Push on, push on!"
Said the Hermit cheerily.
The boat came closer to the ship,
But I nor spake nor stirred;
The boat came close beneath the ship,
And straight a sound was heard.
Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread:
It reached the ship, it split the bay;
The ship went down like lead.

THE ANCIENT MARINER
Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote,
Like one that hath been sevendays drowned My body lay afloat;
But swift as dreams, myself I found Within the Pilot's boat.
Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,
The boat spun round and round;
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.
I moved my lips-the Pilot shrieked And fell down in a fit ;
The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
Andprayed where he did sit.
I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,
Laughed loud and long, andallthe while His eyes went to and fro.
"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,
The Devil knows how to row."
And now, all in my own countree,
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepped forth fromthe boat,
And scarcely he could stand.
"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"
The Hermit crossed his brow.
"Say quick, " quoth he, "I bid thee say- What manner of man art thou?"

THE ANCIENT MARINER
Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
With a woful agony,
Which forced me to begin my tale;
And then it left me free.
Since then, at an uncertain hour,
That agony returns :
And till my ghastly tale is told,
This heart within me burns.
I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech ;
That moment that his face I see,
I know the man that must hear me:
To him my tale I teach.
What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The wedding-guests are there :
But in the garden-bower the bride
And bride-maids singing are :
And hark the little vesper bell
Which biddeth me to prayer!
O Wedding- Guest! this soul hath been
Alone on a wide wide sea:
So lonely 'twas, that God himself
Scarce seemed there to be.
O sweeter than the marriage-feast,
"Tis sweeter far to me,
To walk together to the kirk
With a goodly company !

THE ANCIENT MARINER
To walk together to the kirk,
And all together pray,
While each to his great Father bends,
Old men, and babes, and loving friends And youths and maidens gay!
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou Wedding-Guest !
He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast.
He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small ;
For the dear God who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.
The Mariner, whose eye is bright,
Whose beard with age is hoar,
Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest Turned from the bridegroom's door.
He went like one that hath been stunned,
And is of sense forlorn :
Asadder and a wiser man,
He rose the morrow morn.

THE BELLS
By Edgar Allan Poe
EAR the sledges with the bellsSilver bells !
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight ;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsFrom the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells !
What aworld of happiness their harmony foretells !
Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight !
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What agush of euphony voluminously wells !
How it swells !
How it dwells

THE BELLS
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the rhyming and the chiming of the bells !
Hear the loud alarum bellsBrazen bells !
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright !
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
Inthe clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In amad expostulation with the deaf and frantic
fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now-now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells !
What a tale their terror tells
Of despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air !
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,

THE BELLS
How the danger ebbs and flows ;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bellsOf the bellsOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsIn the clamor and the clangor of the bells.
Hear the tolling of the bells- Iron bells !
What a world of solemn thought their monody
compels !
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone !
For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people-ah, the people- They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stoneThey are neither man nor woman- They are neither brute nor human- They are Ghouls :

THE BELLS
And their king it is that tolls ;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
Rolls
Apæan from the bells !
And his merry bosom swells With the pæan of the bells !
And he dances and he yells ;
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pean of the bells- Of the bells :
Keeping time, time, time In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the sobbing of the bells,
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In ahappy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells- Of the bells, bells, bellsTo the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bellsTo the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
