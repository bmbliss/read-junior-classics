SING a song of sixpence,
A bag full of rye;
Four and twenty blackbirds Baked in a pie ;
When the pie was open'd,
The birds began to sing ;
Was not that a dainty dish
To set before the king?
The king was in his counting-house,
Counting out his money;
The queen was in the parlor,
Eating bread and honey ;
The maid was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,
There came a little blackbird,
And snapped off her nose.

A DILLER, a dollar,
A ten-o'clock scholar,
What makes you come so soon?
You used to come at ten o'clock,
But now you come at noon.

SIMPLE SIMON met a pieman,
Going to the fair ;
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Let me taste your ware.'
Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
Show me first your penny.
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
"Indeed I have not any.
Simple Simon went a-fishing
For to catch a whale :
All the water he had got
Was in his mother's pail!

LITTLE boy blue, come, blow your horn;
The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn.
"Where's the little boy that looks after the sheep ?"
"He's under the hay-cock, fast asleep. "
"Will you wake him?" "No, not I ;
For if I do, he'll be sure to cry.

DAFFY-DOWN-DILLY has come up to town
In a yellow petticoat and a green gown.
LITTLE Nancy Etticote,
In a white petticoat,
With a red nose ;
The longer she stands
The shorter she grows.

WHEN I was a bachelor I lived by myself,
And all the meat I got I put upon a shelf ;
The rats and the mice did lead me such a life
That I went to London to get myself a wife.
The streets were so broad and the lanes were sonarrow,
I could not get my wife home without a wheelbarrow ;
The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall,
Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife, and all.

GREAT A, little a,
Bouncing B!
The cat's in the cupboard,
And can't see me.

PUSSY-CAT, pussy-cat, where have you been?
I've been up to London to look at the queen.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?
I frighten‚ùúd a little mouse under the chair.

For gentlemen ;
Sometimes nine,
And sometimes ten.

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall ;
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back again.

CURLY locks ! curly locks ! wilt thou be mine?
Thou shalt not wash dishes, nor yet feed the swine,
But sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam,
And feed upon strawberries, sugar, and cream!
THE north wind doth blow,
And we shall have snow,
And what will poor Robin do then?
He'll sit in a barn,
Poor thing!
And to keep himself warm,
Will hide his head under his wing.
Poor thing!

JACK SPRAT could eat no fat,
His wife could eat no lean ;
And so between them both, you see,
They licked the platter clean.

COME let's to bed, says Sleepy-head ;
Tarry a while, says Slow;
Put on the pan, says Greedy Nan,
Let's sup before we go.

Pease pudding cold,
Pease pudding in the pot,
Nine days old.
Some like it hot,
Some like it cold,
Some like it in the pot
Nine days old.

Buried on Sunday,

DING, dong, bell,
Pussy's in the well!
Who put her in ?-
Little Tommy Lin.
Who pulled her out ?-

What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy-cat,
Who never did any harm,
But killed the mice in his father's barn.

THERE was an old woman toss'd up in a basket
Nineteen times as high as the moon ;
Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,
For in her hand she carried a broom.

"O whither, O whither, O whither, so high?"
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky !"
"Shall I go with thee?" "Ay, by- and-by."

Eating of curds and whey ;

And sat down beside her,
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

Eating a Christmas pie.

And took out a plum,
And said, "What a good boy am I."

The cow jumped over the moon;
The little dog laugh'd
To see the sport,
While the dish ran after the spoon.

LITTLE Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
And can't tell where to find them;
Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
And bring their tails behind them.
Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamt she heard them bleating;
But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
For they were still a-fleeting.
Then up she took her little crook,
Determin'd for to find them;
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
For they'd left all their tails behind 'em.

OLD King Cole
Was a merry old soul,
And a merry old soul washe;
He called for his pipe,
And he called for his bowl,
And he called for his fiddlers three.

And a very fine fiddle had he ;
Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers.
Oh, there's none so rare
As can compare
With King Cole and his fiddlers three!

Ride to the market to buy a fat hog ;
Homeagain, home again, jiggety-jog.

Brought back the tarts,
And vowed he'd steal no more.

Hewent to bed with his stockings on;
One shoe off, and one shoe on,
Diddle, diddle dumpling, my son John.

She had so many children she didn't know what to do;
She gave them some broth without any bread;
She whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.

GOOSEY, goosey, gander,

And threw him downstairs.

Pups will bark, and Puss will mew.
Go to sleep, and never fear,
Mother will call when morning's near.

KIND hearts are gardens,
Kind thoughts are roots,
Kind words are blossoms,
Kind deeds are fruits.
I HAD a little pony They called him Dapple-grey.

To ride a mile away.

She rode him through the mire.
I would not lend my pony now,
For all the lady's hire.

HUSHABY, baby, thy cradle is green;
Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
Sister's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
Brother's a drummer, and drums for the king.
Rockabye, baby, on the tree top ;
When the wind blows the cradle will rock ;
Whenthe bough breaks the cradle will fall ;
Downwill come baby, bough, cradle, and all.

THERE is very little trouble That happens us to-day,
It's the sorrow of to-morrow
That drives our joys away.
Wesometimes sit and wonder
And stew and fume and fret
For fear something may happen,
But it hasn't happened yet.

MISTRESS MARY, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
With cockle-shells, and silver bells,
And pretty maids all a-row.

HEARTS, like doors, will open with ease,
To very, very little keys,
And don't forget that two of these Are, "I thank you," and "If you please!"
