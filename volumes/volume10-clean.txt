  <title>WEATHER SONG</title>
  <author>Anonymous</author>
  When the weather is wet,
  We must not fret.
  When the weather is cold,
  We must not scold.
  When the weather is warm,
  We must not storm,
  But be thankful together,
  Whatever the weather.
  <title>THE OLD WOMAN WHO BOUGHT A LITTLE PIG</title>
  <author>Anonymous</author>
  An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked sixpence. "What," said
  she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go
  to market, and buy a little pig."
  As she was coming home, she came to a stile;
  but the pig would not go over the stile.
  She went a little further, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog-
  "Dog, dog, bite pig!
  Pig won't get over the stile,
  And I shan't get home to-night."
  But the dog would not.
She went a little further, and she met a stick. So
she said-
"Stick, stick, beat dog!
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the stick would not.
She went a little further, and she met a fire. So
she said-
"Fire, fire, burn stick!
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the fire would not.
She went a little further, and she met some
water. So she said-
"Water, water, quench fire!
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the water would not.
So she went a little further, and she met an ox.
So she said-
"Ox, ox, drink water!
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the ox would not.
She went a little further, and she met a butcher.
So she said-
"Butcher, butcher, kill ox!
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the butcher would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rope.
So she said-
"Rope, rope, hang butcher!
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the rope would not.
She went a little further, and she met a rat. So
she said-
"Rat, rat, gnaw rope!
Rope won't hang butcher;
Butcher won't kill ox;
Ox won't drink water;
Water won't quench fire;
Fire won't burn stick;
Stick won't beat dog;
Dog won't bite pig;
Pig won't get over the stile,
And I shan't get home to-night."
But the rat would not.
She went a little further, and she met a cat. So
