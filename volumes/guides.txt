WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON'S
READING GUIDE FOR THE
D
JUNIOR CLASSICS
R. WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON, Presi- dent of Smith College, Northampton, Mass.,
formerly Professor of English, Harvard Univer- sity, has so enriched The Junior Classics by his
comprehensive Reading Guide on each and every volume of the set as to make the set, which is a
vast storehouse of literary treasures, a collection of practical, workable textbooks of literature for the education of the young readers.
The Junior Classics contain the greatest literature of prose and poemthat every junior must have onwhich to build a firm foundation for the development of a well-balanced education.
Indiscriminate reading is pure and simple pleasure-reading, whereas systematic reading, that is, reading with the object in view of completely covering a subject or period of literature, is educa- tional reading and permanent in value.
Dr. Neilson in his Reading Guide to The Junior
Classics has provided just this systematic course of reading that firmly imprints on the mind the gems of prose and poetry of the collection.

VOLUME I
FAIRY AND WONDER TALES
HERE are people who doubt the wisdom of permitting
their children to hear or to read fairy tales. In their
zeal for truth, they fear that these narratives of the
impossible and the fantastic will accustom the young mind
to falsehood and cancel their efforts to train their boys and
girls in habits of veracity. This attitude is due to two things chiefly: a verbal confusion, and an ignoring of some
familiar facts in the development of the human mind.
For, in the first place, everybody knows that a fictitious tale
that makes no pretense of being history is a quite different thing from a lie, which implies the intent to deceive;
and a very slight observation of children makes it clear
that it is only sophisticated grown-up people who need to
have the distinction pointed out. In the second place, the
world of imagination is the natural habitation of the child.
The inverted chair which serves in turn as steamship, pulpit, locomotive, or fortress is only a symbol of the triumphant mastery of mind over matter in the young, a mastery which is only too soon checked by the pressure of material
fact in the modern world. As the boy grows to manhood,
453
READING GUIDE
his preeminence among his fellows largely depends on the
extent to which his imaginative powers have resisted and
survived this attack. In the field of morals, it needs imagination to create that sympathy, that power of putting one's
self in the other man's place, without which philanthropic
effort is apt to be tactless, cold, and even injurious.
the fields of science and industry, imaginative range, the
capacity to form clear visions of combinations and developments not yet realized, is the most precious of faculties.
In the field of art, imagination is the mainspring, and everything else is merely contributory. Thus it is not dangerous
but only wise, during that period when the imagination is naturally most active, to feed and guide rather than suppress it; and these stories, gathered largely from the youth
of the world, are among the most potent aids to this end.
In
The Junior Classics begin appropriately with the tales
of our own Indians. These represent that stage of civilization when as yet man did not distinguish different kinds
of existence, and stones, clouds, trees, beasts, and men were
thought of as all having the same kind of life, as all having
souls, and so being capable of intercommunication, interchange of forms, and even intermarriage. This belief explains not only the names, but also many of the strange
incidents of these mythological tales. Most of the Indian
stories here given were gathered by Schoolcraft, the distinguished student of the American Indian and collector of
their legends. It was from Schoolcraft that Longfellow
derived his material for Hiawatha, and that poem may fitly
beused as asequel to these tales as the children grow older.
Manabozho, who appears in the frontispiece of this volume,
wasthe Algonquin Hiawatha.
Of many of the tales from India an explanation may again
be found in a current belief. The teaching of the Buddha
included the doctrine of transmigration of souls, and both
the frequency of animal stories and the constant teaching of
kindness to animals are due to this belief, abelief which be
454
READING GUIDE
comes very vivid when one realizes that according to it one's
dogmay have the soul of one's father.
Most of the other stories belong to the great body of
folk-tales, derived from very various sources and ever travelling from district to district and people to people, sometimes springing up independently in surprisingly similar
shapes, but in general full of the charm and entertainment of the genuinely popular tale. Some, however, are deliberately invented: those of the Danish Hans Andersen, most
successful of all moderns in the imitation of the traditional
fairy tale; and those, centuries older, that go by the name
of the shadowy Esop, fables made by many men in many
lands and at many times, for the purpose of embodying the
fragments of worldly wisdom which are usually summed up
in their "morals."

VOLUME II
FOLK TALES AND MYTHS OF ALL NATIONS
T
HE earliest myths everywhere were the attempts of
primitive people to explain the world in which they
lived, early science as much as religion, in which imagination played more part than observation or experiment. American Indian stories, such as those in the first
volume, are as pure an example of these myths as any; and
a special type is to be found in those called by folk-lorists
"pourquois" or why-stories like "Why the Hippopotamus
Lives in the Water," and "Why the Elephant Has Small
Eyes. " Here the attempt to satisfy primitive curiosity, a
curiosity which is as apparent in every child as in every young race, is to be seen undisguised by the trimmings of
the literary artist.
But as time went on and civilization developed, people
become more critical and exacting. The tellers of the
myths found it necessary to make their stories hold together
better, and conform to man's gradually increasing knowledge of nature. In many cases, the primitive scientific
purpose of the myth was lost sight of altogether, and the
tale developed as a piece of entertainment, sometimes attached to gods, or to ancestry, or to the history of the nation,
but interesting chiefly as a story. The pieces contained in
this volume illustrate various stages of this process, from the why-stories just mentioned to the purely literary retelling of local legends like Washington Irving's "Rip Van
Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Stories
like those of Thor and Balder, and the Norse explanation
of "How All Things Began" belong obviously to the period
of attempted answers to the universal questions of Whence ?
456
READING GUIDE
How? Why? while those of Brunhilda and Siegfried and
of Lohengrin are later, but still much more primitive than
the re-tellings of the same stories in the music dramas of
Wagner. Iceland was converted to Christianity about the
year 1000 A. D., and the stories of the mythological sagas of the North, here exemplified, originated before that
date, though in their written forms they belong to Christian
times. They represent the religious legends of the pagan
Norsemen, elaborated and made more coherent by later
writers. Modern poems like William Morris's "Sigurd the
Volsung" and translations of the Nibelungenlied may well
be used to give older children a fuller knowledge of these
themes.
The Greek myths here represented are also far removed
from the primitive type, and in the form in which they
have come down to us show abundant traces of the more or
less conscious handling of generations of story-tellers, who
have added much to the interest and picturesqueness of the original myths, while they have dropped many elements
which had either become meaningless, or had come to be
felt too barbarous for the taste of a more refined age. The
"Story of Cupid and Psyche" is an instance of a quite late
mythological tale, the form in which we know it appearing
first in The Golden Ass of Apuleius, as late as the second
century of our era.

VOLUME III
TALES FROM GREECE AND ROME
E have now seen how the myth is gradually transformed into the artistic story, the element of the
explanation of nature giving way to the desire to glorify the family or nation, or to the interest in an absorbing narrative. The "Old Greek Tales" which occupy the
first two hundred pages of the present volume are very
close to the "Myths of Greece and Rome" of the second
volume, and all of them are far from being pure myths.
One evidence of this is the tendency of the stories to gather
round a center, some great hero or far-reaching event; and
the organization of these groups is evidence enough of the
presence of the work of artists in fiction. The stories connected with such demigods as Hercules, or such heroes as
Theseus and Jason, are prominent examples; but the most
famous of all are the tales which center in the siege of Troy,
and which formed the theme not only of the great Greek
epics, but also of a considerable number of the Greek
tragedies.
The "Tales of the Trojan War" and "The Homeward
Voyage of Ulysses" are, of course, derived from the Iliad
and Odyssey of Homer, and older children may well be encouraged to read these in the complete translations of Lang,
Leaf, and Myers, and of Butcher and Lang. The original
material of these poems had certainly passed through the
mouths of many generations of Greeks before it was committed to writing. Separate episodes had been chanted in public by professional reciters, and the form in which we
know the stories is the result of the moulding of many minds, and betrays the reaction upon the material of the
459
READING GUIDE
tastes and emotions of generations of auditors. Who
finally organized them into their present shape, when they
became two complete epics, whether Homer alone was the
final editor, who Homer himself was, if he was anything
but a name-these are questions upon which scholars are
not yet agreed, and probably will never be agreed. But of
the perennial interest of the deeds of Achilles and Hector,
of the romantic wanderings of Ulysses, of the singular nobility and simplicity of the story-telling, there is and can
be no question. Here for all time is a storehouse of great
deeds, of noble emotions, of universal types of human
character, that can never cease to influence the ideals of
the race.
In the Eneid of Virgil the Roman poet took the Homeric
epics as his model, and strove with all the skill of a great
literary artist to weld the traditions of his people into a
work that would be to his nation what the Iliad and the
Odyssey were to the Greeks. The material, as before, was
legendary and connected with Troy; but here the whole
transmutation into a heroic poem was the work of one man,
gaining thus unity and polish, but wanting, as was inevi- table, much of the spontaneity, freshness, and "popularity,"
in the best sense, which constitute so much of the charm of
Homer.

VOLUME IV
HEROES AND HEROINES OF CHIVALRY
N this volume we pass from the myths and legends of antiquity to the romances and chronicles of the Middle
Ages. An old French writer once classified the materials of narrative poetry into three divisions, the matter of
Britain, the matter of France, and the matter of Rome.
To him the matter of Rome meant mainly the exploits of
Julius C√¶sar; of France, the deeds of Charlemagne and
his peers; of Britain, the stories of Arthur and the Round
Table. The last two of these are abundantly represented
here.
The historical Arthur was a British chieftain who led
his people in their attempts to beat off the invasion of the
pagan Angles and Saxons about the latter part of the fifth
century of our era. It is one of the ironies of history that
he should have become the most prominent hero in the
literature of the descendants of the people against whom
he fought. The small fragment of historical fact about Arthur was elaborated from legendary and imaginative
sources by chroniclers and romancers in England and
France; and, after the development of chivalry, he took his
place in the French and later in the English romances as
the ideal king and Christian knight, the center of a vast
cycle of stories which spread through all the countries of
western Europe.
Toward the close of the Middle Ages, an English gentleman and soldier, Sir Thomas Malory, retold in prose a
great number of these romantic tales, and it is on his form
of them that the version in the present collection is based.
Older readers may be directed to the vigorous if some
462
READING GUIDE
what archaic prose of Malory himself, and to modern poetical versions like those of Arnold, Morris, Swinburne, and especially of Tennyson in the Idylls of the King. Though these stories present a picture of a society such as probably never existed in just this form (and cer- tainly not in the time of the historical Arthur), they yet
give an inspiring view of the chivalrous ideal which has
exercised so potent an influence on conduct these many
centuries.
The tales of Havelok and Horn are favorable examples
of the medi√¶val romances which were not attached to the
court of Arthur, and represent a somewhat simpler social
life than the Arthurian romances.
Among the various sources from which were gathered the stories that became connected with Arthur were the
Welsh legends. Some of these were genuine Celtic tales,
others had been earlier borrowed from the neighboring
French and English; and a collection of them, made for the
use of professional story-tellers, is known as The Mabinogion, from which, in Lady Guest's translation, the second
section of the present volume is drawn. The complete work
is now easily accessible, and contains a number of excellent
stories.
The poetic treatment of the "matter of France" began
with the famous Song of Roland and extended into the
huge mass of so-called chansons de geste, second in interest
only to the Arthurian stories in the literature of Old
French. This, like the "matter of Britain," spread to all
the surrounding countries, but it was in Italy, next to
France itself, that it attained its greatest popularity. Not only did it supply themes to artistic poets like Ariosto and
Boiardo, but the stories of Charlemagne continue to this
day as the favorite reading of the common people in Italy;
and one may see in the puppet theatres of the Italian
quarter of New York a vigorous if crude representation of
the deeds of Roland and Oliver, applauded with heartfelt
463
READING GUIDE
enthusiasm by our Italian fellow-citizens. In the present
selection the most striking episodes of the Song of Roland are given in simple form, and the whole poem may be read
in agood English verse translation.
What Charlemagne and Roland were to the French, the
Cid was to the Spanish; and Southey's version of The
Chronicle of the Cid properly takes its place here beside
the Morte d'Arthur and the Roland.
These romantic narratives are all in a sense aristocratic,
both in the personages with whom they deal and in the audiences for which they were originally composed. The ballads
dealing with Robin Hood, however, are of the common people,
and give an equally vigorous presentation of popular ideals
of justice and fair play.
The Tales from Chaucer are typical examples of the
work of that master of story-tellers : all of them far older
than Chaucer, but owing to his tact and skill, their admirable rapidity and point. The story of "Patient Griselda"
is interesting not only as showing a feminine ideal remote
enough from ours, but also as having come to Chaucer
through the versions of the two great Italians, Boccaccio
and Petrarch.
By the end of the sixteenth century, chivalry as an institution had practically passed away, but it continued largely
to dominate imaginative literature until the Spaniard, Cervantes, turned the outworn romantic material to ridicule
in his satire, Don Quixote. This great novel has escaped
the usual fate of satires of contemporary life because it
rises above the merely temporary and deals with permanent elements in human nature and society with such insight and humor that it appeals to us almost as keenly as
it did to the men for whom it was written. It is placed here appropriately enough with the romances which it
satirizes, but it may be found that it suits the taste of
somewhat older readers than the youngest who can enjoy Arthur and Roland.

VOLUME V
STORIES THAT NEVER GROW OLD
INCE the first translation of The Thousand and One
Nights into English, they have held a unique place
in the interest of young readers. Remote though they
are in every way from the experience of the Western
peoples, fantastic and extravagant in their use of magic and the supernatural, they never fail to hold the attention,
and, in spite of their imaginative wildness, they give a
living picture of the manners and mode of life of the gorgeous East. They are, of course, not the work of one
man, but the fitting into a single framework of a great
variety of stories found in many forms throughout the
Orient.
It is a far cry from the Arabian Nights to Robinson
Crusoe, with its fictitious adventures presented with all
the circumstantial detail of sober history. No one has excelled Defoe in this particular trick of realism, and much
of the hold of the book is due to the illusion that results
from it. But the nature of Crusoe's adventures are precisely
such as to interest boys in the camping and boat-building
stage, and none of Defoe's many imitators have been able
to surpass him.
In writing Gulliver's Travels, Swift had no intention of providing entertainment for the young. His aim was
to make a satire, in part on the government of England in
his day, in part on human nature at large. The point of
much of the satire has disappeared, and practically none
of it is perceived by the modern child; but there happens
to remain in the narrative medium in which he conveyed
his satire a residuum of exciting adventure which makes
466
READING GUIDE
the book a children's classic. It is, however, best read by the
young in selections.
The Pilgrim's Progress is another accidental children's
classic. The work is an elaborate allegory of the Christian
life interpreted in terms of Puritan theology; but, like all
the best allegory, the surface story is interesting on its own
account, and it is for this that children read it. The
spiritual meaning, however, is by no means so obscure as
Swift's satire in Gulliver; but there need be no fear of theological bias. Whatever of the underlying meaning is likely to be caught by the young reader, is of the nature of gen- erally accepted moral and religious truth; and some of the
characters rank with the great creations of modern fiction as
permanent types of human nature.
Of the stories of Shakespeare's plays and Scott's novels
there is no need to speak. Their chief function here is to
give such a taste of these writers as will entice the reader
to go direct to the fountain head.
The literature of adventure reaches its anti-climax in The
Startling Adventures of Baron Munchausen. This is a classic
of the preposterous, and few children fail to enjoy this extreme example of the humor of the long-bow.

VOLUME VI
OLD-FASHIONED TALES
ITH this volume we arrive at a period in which it is no longer necessary to deal with translations
and modernizations, but in which we have the advantage of reading the actual words of the original writers
without that loss of flavor and accent entailed by even the
best translation.
The first half of the sixth volume contains stories which,
although by modern authors, are largely modeled on folkstories of the type contained in the earlier volumes. Some are examples of how close some of our writers in English
can come to the skill in fairy tales shown by Hans Ander- sen. Others, like Hawthorne's "Great Stone Face," have
an underlying meaning, yet not so deeply buried as to be
beyond the reach of young readers, and adding to the entertainment of the literal tale the pleasure of deciphering ariddle
and the profit of a great lesson.
Some of the extracts are beautiful merely as English prose.
The specimens from Ruskin, Dickens, and Hawthorne can
be read aloud in such away as,bymaking obvious the beauty
of their style, to cultivate the ear of the listeners, and begin
to add, though unconsciously at first, to the delight in the
story the more subtle enjoyment that comes from the perception of fine cadences.
The work of Lewis Carroll stands alone. There is
humor in the very idea of the sober Oxford clergyman
and lecturer on mathematics, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson,
disporting himself with the most delightful nonsense ever
written, for the entertainment of a small girl. Alice in
Wonderland and its companion volume, Through the Looking
469
READING GUIDE
Glass, have the ideal qualities of books to be read aloud
by adults to children; for while the young listener is delighted with the fantastic absurdities of the story, the reader
has his own reward in the delicate irony that plays about
the descriptions of the actors and incidents, and in the brilliant cleverness constantly exhibited both in the phrasing
and in the conceiving of situations. Moreover, these are
essentially social books. If any reader, perusing them in solitude, fails to find the charm, let him have patience till
he has tried them incompany. Friendships have been formed
on no solider basis than a capacity to exchange allusions
to Alice; and many agrown-up has found his way to a child's
heart through a common acquaintance with the Hatter and
the March Hare.

VOLUME VII
STORIES OF COURAGE AND HEROISM
HE contents of the seventh volume deal, for the
most part, with historical persons and events, and
cxhibit qualities of courage and heroism in action.
The episodes are gathered from a wide range of place and
time, from the illustrious figures of antiquity to the unnamed heroes of obscure crises in our own land and day;
but the greater number tell of deeds an acquaintance with
which is an essential part of everyone's intellectual background. The Spartans at Thermopyle, Julius C√¶sar
crossing the Rubicon, the English victories at Crecy and
Poitiers, the heroism of Joan of Arc, the tragedy of James
I of Scotland, the voyages of Columbus, the seadogs of
the age of Elizabeth, the adventures of the pioneers of
America, the pathos of the Acadian exiles, the glories and
terrors of the Napoleonic wars, the peaceful heroism of
Grace Darling-such themes as these are of vast influence
on more than one side of a child's education. The accounts
of such things given here are necessarily short, but they
should serve to introduce young readers to some of the
most glorious achievements in human history, and at the
same time to rouse that curiosity which is the best introduction to the serious study of history.
But the most important educational effect of these fragments of heroism is in the formation of character. The
kind of man a boy is to become is largely determined by
the kind of man he admires; and the reading of stories
such as are contained in this volume may be of great
importance in forming his admirations. Though here we
are dealing with historical personages and historical happenings, it is still through the imagination that the effect
471
READING GUIDE
on character is produced. Out of what he sees and hears
the boy gradually and unconsciously forms his ideal of
what he would like to be; and it is important that he should be made familiar with figures more loftily heroic than
the pitcher of the local baseball team, if we wish him to aim
at acareer higher than that of aprofessional athlete.
The attaining of this end of influence on character does
not, however, imply the turning of the stories into texts
for moral lectures. The effect, as has been said, is unconscious. The important thing is that the talk about a
story which has been read should bring out clearly the point
wherein the heroism lay, and this is done all the more effectively when it is not reduced to abstract terms, but left a
vivid concrete imaginative picture of a real human being
doing a fine thing.

VOLUME VIII
ANIMAL AND NATURE STORIES
E have in this volume a great variety of tales dealing with external nature and the lives of animals.
In such matters the normal child has a spontaneous interest, which in the country expresses itself in
endless explorations and collections, with all their attendant educational advantages in the training of observation and resource. But not all children live in the country, and
even in the country children cannot always be in the woods.
Tales such as the present are in part a substitute for country life, in part a supplement to it. They supply information about the habits of animals and the like, they rouse
curiosity, they sharpen observation. A boy reads in a
story of some characteristic of a familiar animal which
he has never noticed: next time he sees it with different
eyes.
On the intellectual side, few qualities are more worth cultivating than this of keen first-hand observation, and a child's
natural interest in animals supplies the obvious starting-point
for its development.
But these stories have another function than that of
entertaining and piquing curiosity. Most of them deal with
the brute creation in a humanitarian spirit, and, without
sacrificing truth to nature, are calculated to put the reader
into a sympathetic attitude toward animals. Here, again,
the imagination is called into beneficent operation, with the
result of a widening of the child's emotional and sympathetic range. You can tell almost as much, though different things, about a man from the way he treats a dog
as from the way he meets a man; and any discipline which
473
READING GUIDE
refines as does training in the proper treatment of animals
is well worth while.
The danger of much modern writing about animals is
sentimentality. The brutes are used as occasions for the
enjoyment of pathetic emotions, often without regard for
truth to nature, or the effect of such cheap pathos on the
reader. A sympathetic attitude such as is implied in the
stories in this volume is to be distinguished from such
sentimentality. More and more knowledge of natural history, such as this book is meant to create an appetite for,
will check foolish emotion without destroying kindliness,
and beget a real respect for animal intelligence and anima!
rights.

VOLUME IX
STORIES OF TO- DAY
HE first part of this volume consists of stories by modern writers dealing mainly with life in our own
day. They are, of course, meant for the older children, and both the style and the situations call for more
maturity on the part of the reader. The lure of the extraordinary is now dispensed with, and instead these tales
supply the interest that comes from recognizable truth to
experience.
When a boy reaches a certain stage in his development
he is apt to become impatient of the fantastic and impossible in fiction. The sense of fact which his everyday life
and most of his study in school have been cultivating finally
becomes the dominant element, and it tends to reject summarily all that offends it. For some years now the physical is in the ascendant, and the child is passing through
the most precarious period of his life. The imaginative
and ideal elements were never more important than at this
time, and yet these are precisely what he is most likely to
reject in his reading. The lavish use of such qualities in
the books of his earlier years is now merely irritating to
him, and a substitute is urgently needed.
It is at this point that wholesome modern fiction of a
more realistic type can serve a lofty educational purpose.
The care of the best modern writers of fiction for accuracy
of detail, for faithfulness to local color, for technical exactness in the description of both internal and external matters, appeals to a youth just beginning to pride himself on
his grasp of reality, and lays him open to whatever else the
writer may have to offer. What these stories have to give 475
READING GUIDE
is a number of pictures of life, presented vividly and con- vincingly, and in proportion to their truth and vigor serving as a kind of vicarious experience. The reading of such
fiction, with a lively realization of the scenes and characters,
is not only an exercise of the imagination abundantly rewarded
by the pleasure obtained, but is also amoral gymnastic, through
its stretching and supplying of the capacity for sympathy
with one's fellows.
The list of fiction contained in these volumes, representing the imaginative product of almost all races and times,
is fitly closed by the gift made to the children of England of
a story for themeslves by the master of English novelists,
William Makepeace Thackeray.

VOLUMEX
POEMS OLD AND NEW
THE previous volumes have provided roughly a progression from the simplest fairy tales to modern fic- tion not written primarily for young people. The wise guide will, of course, not follow this order slavishly,
but will pick and choose in accordance with the taste of
the individual child. For, in spite of the stress that has
been laid in these remarks on the educative value, intellectual and moral, of the stories, it must never be forgotten
that whatever ulterior end literature may serve, it must
do it by pleasing. If, then, any selection, however delightful to the adult, fails to entertain the child, it should be
laid aside for a later time. The material here gathered is
to be regarded not as a means of discipline, but as a source
of joy; and anything that would introduce unpleasant associations with these volumes should be avoided as endangering the main ends they are created to serve.
If this is true of the prose, it is still more true of the
poetry. Indeed, there is no excuse here for either tedium or labor, so rich is the variety, so wide the range. The
collection of poems begins with the simplest nursery rhymes,
to be said, or, better, sung to the child from its earliest
years, until it has them all by heart. The habit of committing verse to memory thus begun should be kept up throughout childhood, care being taken that the poems find
a lodgment not through drudgery but as the result of delighted repetition.
In this way a child may arrive at the end of his school- days to find himself in possession of a large body of
poetry, much of it from the pens of the greatest of our
477
READING GUIDE
writers. The profit of this in enjoyment, in the cultivation of the ear for the beauty of words and rhythms, in
the storing of the memory with fine phrases and noble
thoughts, in the familiarity with rich and elevated feeling,
has been pointed out by Mr. Eliot in the Introduction, and
need not be further urged here. Something of the best and
most delightful of such poets as Shakespeare, Milton, Dry- den, Burns, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Scott, Byron, Keats,
Tennyson, Browning, Longfellow, and Emerson will be
found, along with the most exquisite of the simpler products of minor pens. The table is spread with abundance:
these notes are meant merely to give hints for serving the
feast.

JUNIOR CLASSICS CONTENTS
ARRANGED ACCORDING TO GRADES
WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON, PH. D.
President Smith College, Northampton, Mass., formerly Professor of English, Harvard University
T
HE following lists represent an attempt to
arrange the contents of The Junior Classics to
fit successive degrees of maturity. The basis
adopted is that of the eight grades of the American
public school, and many of the selections are those
recommended for the various grades in prescribed
courses of study. It is clear, of course, that between the groups of material suggested for these
classes no hard lines can be drawn ; neither children nor books submit to rigid classification. Some
fifth-grade boys can enjoy seventh-grade stories,
and many stories and poems appeal to all grades
of boys. Yet it may facilitate the use of these
volumes to have indicated to which pieces a reader
of a given age may be first introduced. Once the
door has been opened, it is safe to prophesy that
the young reader will find his way in this rich
storehouse for himself.
