# Contributing to Read the Junior Classics

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, and code changes.

Please read the motivation and goals of the project before contributing:

The project stems from a personal experience with the Junior Classics book set, which provides a guided timeline for reading classic literature to children based on their grade level. I started with an paper version of this idea on my fridge to track which stories and poems have been read so far, a rating and a rough timeline to read them for each child based on their current grade. The goal is to digitize and expand upon this concept, creating a tool that helps parents and educators introduce children to classic literature in a structured, age-appropriate manner.

## App Goals and Value Proposition

1. Primary Goal: Encourage reading of classic literature, particularly the Junior Classics series.
2. Target Audience: Parents, teachers, and children.
3. Value Proposition: 
   - Provide a structured approach to reading classic literature.
   - Offer flexibility to accommodate various reading programs and personal preferences.
   - Track reading progress over extended periods (6-8 years).
   - Foster a community of readers sharing insights and recommendations.

As this project is open source, I don't wish to make any money from this app.
